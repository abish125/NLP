2,S11-81395,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LYMPH NODE EXCISION, LEFT INGUINAL:  
B-cell lymphoma, with features intermediate between d
iffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a diffuse follicle center lymphoma.
Note:  The lymph node architecture is effaced by a vaguely nodular to diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells that extend
s into the surrounding adipose tissue.  In the background, there is patchy sclerosis with some sclerotic bands surrounding the nodular proliferation.  The cells within the lymph node are an admixture of small, mature lymphocytes with condensed chromatin a
n
d scant cytoplasm and numerous medium-sized and large atypical cells with vesicular to finely stippled chromatin and often multiple prominent nucleoli, most consistent with centrocytes and centroblasts.  There are, on average, 16 large cells per hpf.  

Flow cytometry (below) shows a small population of monotypic B cells in a reactive background.  Immunohistochemical stains reveal that the atypical cells are CD20+ B cells 
with interspersed small CD3+ T cells.  CD10 stains stromal cells.  CD21 shows focal dendritic staining
; most of the tissue is devoid of follicular dendritic meshworks.  Bcl-2 is diffusely positive.  Bcl-6 stains B cells.  Ki67 stain shows
 a proliferative index of about 20% to 30%.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

Overall, the morphology and immunophenotype are those of a B cell lymphoma, with a predominantly diffuse pattern and with a proportion of centroblasts that is on the border between a diffuse follicle center lymphoma, grade 2 of 3, and a 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  The proliferation index is significantly lower than is usual for a 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Dr. Nancy Harris has also reviewed this difficult case.
This immunoperoxidase test was d
eveloped and its performance characteristics determined by the pathology department at the Massachusetts
 path hospital. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.
 food and drug administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary; this laboratory has established and verified the test's accuracy and precision.

15,S11-85499,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, RIGHT ILIAC CREST, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:  
Persistent metastatic neuroblastoma.  (See note.)
NOTE:
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%.  
Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  There are scattered clusters o
f pleomorphic cells with round to irregular nuclei with granular chromatin, occasionally prominent nucleoli and mod
erately abundant pink cytoplasm,
 sometimes associated with a fibrillar matrix, consistent with neurophil.  Occasional mitotic figures are see
n.  These malignant cells constitute approximately 20% of the marrow cellularity and approximately 18% of the marrow space.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Reticulin fibers tend to encompass aggregates of atypical cells. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation   
A 200 cell count reveals: 65% neutrophils and precursors; 19% erythroid precursors; 13% lymphocytes; 0% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 1% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  
Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  The malignant cells described on the bone marrow core are also present on the aspirate smear,
 in the form of a few small clusters of large atypical cells.  
CBC results from 12/29/11 are as follows: WBC 3.7; Manual HCT 22%; PLT 35.  Auto differential: 35% monos.  
Manual differential: 48% polys; 11% bands.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals predominantly mature neutrophils along with mature monocytes and lymphocytes.  
SUMMARY:  Comparison to the previous bone marrow biopsy (S11-71527; 10/27/11) shows fairly stable involvement of the right iliac crest bone marrow by metastatic neuroblastoma. 
 The morphology of the tumor cells is very similar, as well.

Note:  The four specimens show similar changes.  All include lacrimal gland with adjacent soft tissue and are involved by a lymphoid infiltrate consisting of lymphoid follicles, sometimes
 with active germinal centers, surrounded by a polymorphous mixture of lymphocytes, plasma 
cells, histiocytes and eosinophils.  There is also prominent sclerosis, beginning around small ducts, and also surrounding glandular acini.  In areas broader fibrous bands divide the lymphoid infiltrate into large and small aggregates.  Some samples show 
preservation of much of the gland while in others the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and fibrosis have obliterated all but a few epithelial structures. In specimen A, adjacent to the lymphoplasmacytic is a focus of histiocytes without granuloma formation. 

Giemsa stain was examined on both parts A and B.  Flow cytometric analysis (below) shows no abnormal B or T\endash cell population.  I
mmunohistochemistry performed on A2 reveals the lymphocytes comprise an admixture of CD20+ B cells in follicles, surrounded by perifollicular CD3+ BCL2+ T cells.  BCL6 highlights few
 germinal centers which are negative for BCL2.  Staining for IgG and IgG4 reveals that the majority (>90%) of IgG+ plasma cells are IgG4 positive.  A number of high power fields have >50 IgG4+ cells plasma cells, and in a few
 there are approximately 100 IgG4+ cells/HPF.  CD68 highlights many histiocytes around the periphery of the lesion.  Scattered dendritic cells are S100+, CD1a+ but most histiocytes are negative for S100 and CD1a.
The findings support a diagnosis of sclerosing dacryoadenitis, IgG4-related.  The area with increased histiocytes is unusual but otherwise the histologic and immunophenotypic features are typical of IgG4-related disease.  Dr. Vikram Deshpande has revi
ewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. Of note, the patient is thought to have a history of autoimmune pancreatitis (MS08-66673), which represents another manifestation of IgG4-related disease.

Slightly hypercellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and slight plasmacytosis.  

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%.  
Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear increased in number, with normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggr
egates are seen.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and also occur in small clusters. They consist of mostly mature forms.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 
200- count reveals: 52% neutrophils and precursors; 25% erythroid precursors; 11% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 2% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 8% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  There is an area with many small lymphocytes, consistent with a lymphoid aggregate.

ns will be performed on the marrow biopsy to assess plasma cell clonality and the results will be reported in an addendum.  The hematopoietic elements show no specific abnormality and it
 is possible that the patient's cytopenias are related, at least in part, to factors extrinsic to the marrow

     INTERPRETATION:
     ALL metaphases contained the clonal aberrations described above.  None of the
     clonal aberrations is known to be characteristic of any particular type of
     tumor. However, FISH analysis on abnormal metaphases demonstrated EGFR1
     signal on der(13) , loss of D13S319 sinal and LSI13q34 signal on the add(5).
     These findings suggest a complex rearrangement among chromosome 5, 13 and 20,
     with loss of 13q12q14 region.
     
     FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed on abnormal metaphases with a
     panel of Abbott Molecular probes, including Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual
     Color Probe for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2. One EGR1 signal was
     observed on the terminal region of der(13).
     
     FISH evaluation for a 13q deletion was performed on abnormal metaphases with
     the Vysis LSI D13S319/ LSI13q34 Dual Color Probe Set (Abbott Molecular) for the
     D13S319 at 13q14.3 and the LSI13q34 at 13q34.  D13S319 signal was lost on the
     der(13) and the LSI13q34 signal was translocated on the add(5q).
     
     The above FISH findings suggest a complex rearrangement among chromosomes 5,
     13 and 20 resulting in interstitial deletion of the log arm of 13q,
     del(13)(q12q14).
     
     Deletion of chromosome 13 is another relatively common aberration in myeloid
     disorders.

Hypocellular, erythroid-predominant marrow (see note).  

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 10% (range: 0% to 30%).  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left
.  Erythroid maturation is focally complete but is shifted to the left.  Megakaryocytes are decreased
, with overall normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells.  They comprise mostly mature forms with a few immature forms.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  

The aspirate smear is adequate fo
r evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 2% neutrophils and precursors, 75% erythroid precursors, 8% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation cannot be evaluated.  Eryt
hroid maturation is left-shifted and mildly to moderately dysplastic, with occasional nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear irregularities, and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  

CBC results from 12-30-11 are as follows: WBC 1.2; HGB 8.3; HCT 28.5%; MCV 83 fl; PLT 17.  Manual differential: 3% polys; 77% lymphs; 1% atypical lymphs; 5% monos; 14% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals normal leukocytes and occasional nucleated red blood cells.  There are a few lar
ge cells with deep blue cytoplasm; these could represent
 reactive lymphs or early erythroid forms.  

SUMMARY:  Overall, the findings most likely 
represent progression of the patient's previously diagnosed myeloproliferative neoplasm, with superimposed effects of recent therapy.

Follicular lymphoma, grade 1-2 of 3, follicular pattern (see note).  
Note:   
The sections demonstrate a markedly enlarged lymph node with completely effaced architecture and ill-defined nodularity throughout. The lymph node is replaced by poorly
 delineated follicles occupied by small, convoluted, atypical lymphoid cells with dark nuclei (centrocytes) and scattered larger cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (centroblasts). Mitoses are readily apparent, and occasional histiocytes are scattered singly within the follicles. Immunohistochemistry reveals that the atypical cells are CD20+, BCL-6+
, BCL-2+ B cells clustered in follicles and extending into interfollicular regions. CD3 highlights background reactive small T cells, predomina
ntly in the interfollicular regions. CD21 demonstrates intact follicular dendritic meshworks of varying sizes, occasionally fused together. The Ki-67 proliferation index is slightly increased, approximately 40%. Overall the findings are consistent with a 
low-grade follicular lymphoma with a borderline elevated proliferation index, which may suggest more aggressive behavior.

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 30% (range 10 to 40%).  
Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology.  Reticulin 
stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stains were
 examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case, on both the biopsy and the clot.
The aspirate smear is hemodilute and paucicellular.  A 100-cell count reveals: 73% neutrophils and p
recursors; 13% erythroid precursors; 11% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 1% plasma cell

Slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.  
There is no evidence of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. 
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately
60% (range 40 to 70%).  
Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology.
  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  In areas, eosinophils increased.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200 cell count reveals: 
48% neutrophils and precursors; 25% erythroid precursors; 8
% lymphocytes; 4
% monocytes; 10% eosinophils; 2% basophils; 3% promyelocytes; 
0% blasts; and 0% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is
 normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  
CBC results from 1/4/12 are as follows: WBC 10.9; HGB 10.0; HCT 30.0%; MCV 92 fl; PLT 279.

Summary: There is no evidence of marrow involvement by m
antle cell lymphoma.  There is a mild increase in eosinophils in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.  This is likely related to the patient's recent history of a drug reaction.

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. 
The marrow cellularity is overall >95 % (range 95 to 100 %). 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased. Myeloid maturation is
 complete but shifted to the left. Erythroid maturation is complete. Erythroid elements appear decreased. Megakaryocytes appear adequate

Flow cytometry shows a monoclonal B-cell population (see below).  Immunostains on paraffin sections show a mixture 
of many CD20+ B cells and CD3+ CD5+ T cells throughout the node.  There is a suggestion of dim staining for CD5 by some B cells.  A few lymphoid cells are BCL6dim+, possibly non-specific staining.  Lymphoid cells are negative for cyclin D1.  Ki67 (prolife
ration) ranges from 10% to 40% of cells in different areas of the node.  
The histologic and immunophenotypic features are those of a small B-cell lymphoma with features consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma

INTERPRETATION:
No clonal B cell population is identified by this test.

No definitive clonal T cell population is identified. The slightly prominent
peaks in V gamma 1-8 are of uncertain significance.  In addition,
rearrangements involving V gamma 10 locus can be associated with non-neoplastic

The interfollicular area contains small lymphocytes, eosinophils, histiocytes, occasional plasma cells and few immunoblasts
. There is an increase in high endothelial venules. The capsule is thickened and fibrotic, and is involved by the lymphoid proliferation. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
Flow cytometry (see below) shows polytypic B cells and T cells with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio.

Immunostains show many CD20+ B cells in follicles throughout the node and focally beyond the capsule into perinodal soft tissue. B cells are also scattered in the interfollicular area. There are numero
us interfollicular and intrafollicular T cells (CD3+). T cells in follicles are PD1 bright+
, and many interfollicular T cells are PD1 dim+. CD10 stains scattered lymphoid cells within and also outside follicles. CD21 stains follicular dendritic meshworks a
ssociated with follicles brightly. There is also some dim dendritic staining that appears to be interfollicular. Scattered IgG+ plasma cells are present; a few are IgG4+. I
n-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains shows scattered polytypic plasma cells. Stains for HHV8 and 
in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) are negative. An immunostain for spirochetes is negative. 

The findings in this case are unusual and the etiology of the lymphadenopathy is uncer
tain. Some features raise the question of Castleman's disease, but some features, such as the interfollicular eosinophils, do not fit with that consideration. The findings could represent an unusual reactive process, possibly with an underlying immunologi
c
 abnormality. The findings are not sufficient for a diagnosis of lymphoma, but the possibility of early nodal involvement by lymphoma, such as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, cannot be completely excluded. It is possible that recent steroid therapy ma
y have altered the appearance of the lymph node, potentially making any atypical cells less conspicuous.

Tissue will be sent for PCR to investigate the presence of a clonal population. Results will be reported separately. See also results of pending cytogenetics (CG-12-K00161).

Note:  The specimen consists of fragments of bone, bone marrow and skeletal muscle.  The marrow particles are small but they do show maturing trilineage hematopoiesis a
s well as several small and large, somewhat infiltrative aggregates of small lymphoid cells.  The fragmentation of the specimen makes it difficult to determine whether the aggregates are paratrabecular.  There are a few admixed plasma cells and scattered 
mast cells as well.

 reveals the aggregates of small lymphoid cells are predominantly composed of CD3+ CD5+ T cells with scattered CD20+ B cells.  A stain for mast cell tryptase highlights slightly increased numbers of singly scattere
d mast cells in the marrow, without formation of mast cell aggregates.  In-situ hybridization

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, (see note).

Note:  The specimen consists of cores of adipose tissue mostly replaced by a dense, diffuse infiltrate of large atypical lymphoid cells with large oval to slightly irregular vesicular nuclei, and often prominent cen
tral nucleoli. There is interspersed apoptotic debris.  Mitoses are frequent.  Small lymphocytes are scattered around the periphery of areas with large cells.  
Immunohistochemistry reveals that the large cells are B cells (CD20+) which also coexpress CD10,
 bcl-6, variable bcl-2 (dim to strong), and MUM1/IRF4.  The large cells are negative for CD5 and Cyclin D1.  Scattered small CD3+, CD5+ T cells are present at the periphery
; T cells account for most of the small cells.  The Ki-67 index is approximately 80-90%.  A stain for keratin (cocktail) is negative. 
In-situ hybridization (ISH) performed on a paraffin-embedded section reveals no staining with an oligonucleotide probe for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER). 

The findings are consistent with 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Compared to the patient's previously biopsied iliac lymph node (MS11-51312) which showed a low-grade B-cell lymphoma (CD20+, CD5+, CD10-, bcl6-), the current biopsy shows much larger,
 more atypical cells. It is possible that this lymphoma represents large cell transformation of the low-grade lym

     Burkitt lymphomas, but can also be found occasionally in other histologies of
     non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The MYC rearrangements in Burkitt lymphomas result in

     INTERPRETATION:
     
     All metaphases contained the clonal aberrations described above, including
     5q-, a characteristic finding in AML and MDS.
     
     FISH evaluation  with the LIS1 probe  in the Miller-Dieker region at 17p13.3
     and RARA  at 17q21.1  (Abbott Molecular) confirmed the t(17;18) in 5/5
     metaphases examined.
     
     
     FISH for EVI1 rearrangement was performed with the EVI1 Tri-Color Rearrangement
     Probe Set (Cytocell, Ltd) which contains the RP11-669C7/RP11-637O11 probes
     (centromeric to EVI1), the RP11-82C9 probe (includes EVI1), and the RP11-362K14
     probe (telomeric to EVI1) on 3q26.2.
     
     This result is consistent with an inv(3q), which is indicated by an isolated
     RP11-669C7/RP11-637O11 signal in 7% of cells. This result exceeds the normal
     range (up to 3%) established for this probe set in the Cytogenetics Laboratory
     at BWH.
     
     This ABNORMAL result is consistent with an inv(3)(q21q26), which is typically
     seen in myeloid malignancies."

(RIGHT ILIAC CREST) BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Normocellular to slightly hypercellular
 marrow with myeloid left-shift with increased blasts and atypical megakaryocytes, consistent with
 a myelodysplastic syndrome (see note).  
Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen
 contains rare marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50%.  Myeloid maturation is 
shifted to the left.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are slightly increased and occur in focal small clusters.  The megakaryocytes include occasional atypical small forms with hypolobated nuclei sometimes with
 separated nuclear lobes.  Many megakaryocytes are morphologically normal.  Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in small clusters.  The blasts are medium-sized with round, irregular or indented nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant to moderate cytoplasm. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was e
xamined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Few scattered mature plasma cells are seen.  Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that approximately 10% to 15% of marrow cells are CD34+, while approximately 15% are CD117+.  
Th
e aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute and paucicellular.  A 300-cell count reveals: 36% neutrophils and precursors, 30% erythroid precursors, 21% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 2% promyelocytes, 5% blasts, an
d
 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted and mildly dysplastic, with uneven distribution of granules.  Erythroid maturation shows rare binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are not seen.  The blasts are medium to occasionally large-sized with variabl
y
 fine chromatin, oval to indented nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a scant to moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm with occasional granulation.  A smear stained for iron is very paucicellular, but no ringed sideroblasts are seen. 
According to the accom
panying report, cytogenetics on bone marrow from 1-19-12 performed at the outside institution revealed 4.2% of nuclei with fusion of RPN-1 and EVI-1, which usually indicates an inv(3) or t(3;3), by MDS FISH panel.  
CBC results from 1-26-12 are as follows
: WBC 1.6; HGB 10.6; HCT 29.7%; MCV 103 fl; PLT 94.  Manual differential: 17% polys;  3% bands; 0% metamyelocytes; 0% myelocytes; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; 65% lymphs; 0% atypical lymphs; 10% monos; 5% eos;  and 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear
 reveals pancytopenia.  No blasts are identified.  Rare plasmacytoid lymphocytes are seen.  Some of the lymphocytes are large granular lymphocytes.  
SUMMARY:  The findings are those of a somewhat disorganized marrow architecture, with slightly increased megakaryocytes, including few atypical forms, and
 increased myeloid blasts.  The bone marrow aspirate is paucicellular and hemodilute, and thus does not appear to accurately reflect the quantity of blasts in the marrow; accordingly, immunostains on the cor
e biopsy show 10% to 15% blasts.  Per report, recent bone marrow biopsy performed at an outside institution revealed the presence of RPN-1 and EVI-1 fusion by FISH, which may be associated with an aggressive myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.  The current bone marrow biopsy is significantly more cellular than the previous biopsy (S12-5887/S12:001262; 1/19/12), and the overall findings are consistent with a 
myelodysplastic syndrome, best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2).  Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12-W00660).

255,S12-5793,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR (LEFT ILIAC CREST):
Markedly hypocellular marrow with dyserythropoiesis (see note).

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen
 contains rare marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately <5%.  
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.  One megakaryocyte is identified in the clot.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells.  They consist of mature forms.  Also present are scattered small lymphocytes.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. A 200-cell count reveals: 33% neutrophils and precursors, 42% erythroid precursors, 17% lymphocytes; 0% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 2% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 4% plasma cells.  Myeloid m
aturation is slightly left-shifted but complete.  Erythroid maturation is moderately 
abnormal, with nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear irregularities, late mitoses, and basophilic cytoplasmic stippling.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  
Also seen are singly scattered, normally granulated mast cells.  

CBC results from 1-27-12 are as follows: WBC 3.5; HGB 10.1; HCT 29.1%; MCV 108 fl; PLT 35.
  Auto differential: 46% polys; 49% lymphs;  4
% monos; 1% eos;  0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals pancytopenia.  Neutrophils appear normally granulated and lobated.  

SUMMARY:  The bone marrow biopsy is markedly hypocellular, while the aspirate is cellular and 
demonstrates dyserythropoiesis and somewhat left-shifted myeloid forms.  Overall the findings may represent
 the effects of a toxin/drug, vitamin deficiency, or immune-mediated process.  Significant maturational abnormalities are only seen in the erythroid lineage, and overall the morphologic findings are not felt to be diagnostic of myelodysplastic syndrome.  Clinical correlation and review of pending cytogenetics 
(CG-12-J00672) is recommended."

Slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and involvement by small lymphocytic lymphoma (see note).  
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen
 contains rare marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 70%.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are 
adequate, with overall normal morphology.  There are multiple non-paratrabecular aggregates and an interstitial infiltrate
 of small, round to irregular nuclei, with a few admixed larger cells, consistent with prolymphocytes.  The lymphoid cells account for 50% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 35% of the intertrabecular marrow space.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 2
00-cell count reveals: 30% neutrophils and precursors, 11% erythroid precursors, 59% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 0% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal.
 
 Megakaryocytes are not well-sampled.  Most lymphoid cells appear small and mature, with clumped chromatin, round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, and scant basophilic cytoplasm.  Rare larger cells are seen.  Frequent stripped nuclei (""smudge cells
"") are seen in the background. 
CBC results from 1-27-12 are as follows: WBC 6.1; HGB 15.2; HCT 42.4%; MCV 86 fl; PLT 175.  
Auto differential:  49% polys; 39% lymphs; 9
% monos; 2% eos; and 1% basos.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals predominantly m
ature-appearing lymphocytes.  Most lymphoid cells are small, with clumped chromatin.  Rare larger lymphoid cells with more open chromatin are seen.  

SUMMARY:  The overall morphologic and flow cytometric findings are consistent with marrow involvement by a B-cell neoplasm with the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with a nodular and interstitial pattern
.  The peripheral blood (see F12-203) does not contain a large enough clonal B-cell population for a primary diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia.  In a patient with a prior diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma (see S11-83295), the findings in this specimen are consistent with marrow involvement by small lymphocytic lymphoma.  The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ha
s noted that, in the absence of other defining features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, >30% lymphoid cells in the marrow are 
characteristically present; >30% lymphoid cells were found in the marrow in the current case.

Slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and involvement by plasmablastic lymphoma.

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80% (range 60 to 90%).  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased with overall normal morphology.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in
 small clusters. They consist of mostly mature forms with a few Russell bodies.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Also seen is a focus occupied by large atypical lymphoid cells with oval to irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, consistent with focal marrow involvement by lymphoma.  Occasional singly scattered similar large cells are present away from this focus.  No granulomas or areas o
f necrosis are seen.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 48% neutrophils and precursors; 32% erythroid precursors; 11% lymphocytes; 4% monocytes;1
% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 2% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  
Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  Many lymphoid cells are small and mature-appearing, through a subset of larger cells with deep blue cytoplasm with cytoplasmic vacuoles is also present.  

CBC results from 1/28/2012 are as follows: WBC 4.4; HGB 11.9; HCT 32.9%; MCV 86 fl; PLT 104.  Manual differential: 68% polys; 12% bands; 1% metamyelocytes; 1% myelocytes; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; 11% lymphs; 0% atypical lymphs; 7%
 monos; 0% eos; 0% basos; 0% other WBCs.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals predominately mature leukocytes with occasional left shifted myeloids.  Rare lymphoid cells appear medium to large sized with more open chromatin, folded nuclei, prominent nuc
leoli, and moderate basophilic cytoplasm with occasional vacuolization.  

Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveals scattered small and large MUM1+ cells, corresponding to plasma cells and the large atypical cells.  In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) shows scattered positive large cells and some small cells.  Plasma cells appear polytypic with 
in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains, but large atypical cells express dim monotypic kappa light chain.  The abnormal cells make up 5 to 10% of marrow cellularity.
SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with marrow involvement by the patient's recently diagnosed EBV+ high-grade lymphoma (most consistent with plasmablastic lymphoma, S12-5337). 
Also see results of cytogenetics (CG12-K00696).

- Normocellular, myeloid-predominant marrow. 
- There is no definitive morphologic or flow cytometric evidence of acute myeloid leukemia, (see note).

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small, but is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 30%. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased. Myeloid maturation is complete. Erythroid elements are rare. A few megakaryocytes 
are present with overall normal morphology. Plasma cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. There are a few scattered monocytic cells interspersed among granulocytic elements.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but paucicellular. The touch prep slide is paucicellular. 
A 200 cell count reveals: 78% neutrophils and precursors; 5% erythroid precursors; 12% lymphocytes; 3% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 1% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is normal. Erythroid maturation is not evaluable
. Megakaryocytes are not seen. Very few slightly atypical monocytic forms are seen.  No increase in blasts is detected.

Review of the peripheral smear reveals normal leukocytes.  No blasts are seen.

SUMMARY:  The marrow architecture is slightly disorganized and erythropoiesis appears decreased.  There is no definitive morphologic or flow cytometric evidence of acute myeloid leukemia.  Thus overall, the finding of the 
presence of a few atypical monocytes is somewhat unusual, but the findings are not felt to be diagnostic of blasts or neoplastic monocytic cells. Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed this case and agrees. Also see results of cytogenetics (CG12G00712)."

NOTE:
The bone marrow b
iopsy specimen is inadequate for evaluation as it consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum with scant fat
.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is not evaluable.  Giemsa stain was examined as pa
rt of the histologic evaluation of this case.  A reticulin stain is noncontributory due to a lack of cellular marrow particles.  The bone present shows prominent remodelling.

Note:  There is a dense subepithelial infiltrate of small lymphocytes, small lymphoid cells with pale cytoplasm, many plasma cells and few large cells. Immunostai
ns show that most lymphoid cells are CD20+ B cells, with scattered admixed T cells (CD3+, CD5+).  B cells appear negative for CD5 and CD10, although in areas CD10 strongly stains the stroma.  There is a suggestion of CD43 co-expression by some B cells and
 plasma cells.  CD21 highlights several dendritic meshworks within the lymphoid infiltrate.  Ki67 (proliferation) stains <5% of cells.  With

Markedly hypocellular marrow (see note).  

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall <5%.  
There is abundant interstitial eosinophilic 
material with areas of loose fibrosis; the scant cellularity consists predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.  
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.  Myeloid elements are very rare.  There are rare islands of maturing erythroid
 elements.  Megakaryocytes are decreased, 
with overall normal morphology and rare small forms.  There are scattered
 non-paratrabecular aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round nuclei.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small, predom
inantly perivascular clusters.  They consist of mature forms.  Also seen are rare immature cells that could possibly represent blasts.  Storage iron is abundant.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ to 3+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The touch prep slide is inadequate for evaluation because of extreme paucicellularity.  

CBC results from 2-1-12 are as follows: WBC 8.5; HGB 7.5; HCT 20.3%; MCV 92 fl; PLT 64.  Manual differential: 52% polys;  
2% bands; 0% metamyelocytes; 1% myelocytes; 0% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; 38% lymphs;  0% atypical lymphs; 6% monos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals thrombocytopenia, occasional nucleated red blood cells, and mature and left-shifted myeloids, includ
ing a rare blast.  Neutrophils demonstrate normal granulation and lobation.  

SUMMARY:  The marrow is markedly hypocellular, with abundant eosinophilic material and a suggestion of loose fibrosis.  Hematopoietic elements are rare.  Compared with the pati
ent's recent bone marrow biopsy (S12-565), the current sample shows a marked decrease in hematopoiesis.  The findings are very unusual, and the significance is uncertain. The WBC is higher than would be expected if this specimen is representative, raising 
the possibility of sampling artifact.  The changes could represent marrow injury, accompanied by loss of hematopoietic elements.  The findings would be very unusual for 
myelodysplastic syndrome.  Stains to enumerate blasts are in progress and will be reported on in an addendum.  Also see results of molecular genetics studies (MS-12-497)."

Markedly hypercellular marrow with myeloid dominant hematopoiesis and increased blasts consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, best classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML-1).  (See note.)

Note: The bone mar
row biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall >95%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is greatly increased.  
Myeloid maturation is complete but shifted to the left in areas
.  Erythroid elements are rare.  Megakaryocytes are decreased.  
The megakaryocytes include occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei.  There are rare scattered aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round nuclei and few mature plasma cell
s.  Also seen are increased numbers of left-shifted monocytic elements.  Scattered
 tingible body macrophages and histiocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm are present along with scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages.  Clusters of cells with morphology consis
tent with plasmacytoid dendritic cells are also seen.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ to 3+(out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count 
reveals: 69% neutrophils and precursors; 1% erythroid precursors; 15% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 3% promyelocytes; 7% blasts; and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted but complete.  Erythroid forms are exceedingly rare.  Rare megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.
  Blasts are medium-sized with fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm with rare granulation.

  Review of the peripheral smear reveals mature and left-shifted myeloid forms including a rare bl
ast.  Myeloid forms overall demonstrate normal granulation.  Monocytes are numerous.  Thrombocytopenia is noted.

SUMMARY:  The findings are those of a markedly hypercellular marrow with myeloid predominant, left-shifted hematopoiesis with increased blasts.  Compared with t

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with unusual features, (see note).
 
B.  LYMPH NODE EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:  
Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with unusual features, (see note).

Note:  The two lymph nodes show similar morphology.
 They are enlarged, with architecture that is distorted but not obliterated.  Sections show scattered, often widely separated, small reactive-appearing lymphoid follicles, sometimes resembling those seen in Castleman's disease.  The expanded interfollicul
a
r area contains small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional immunoblasts.  No Reed-Sternberg cells are identified. Plasma cells occur scattered singly and in clusters.  A few clusters of monocytoid B cells are seen.  Occasional patent sinuses are iden
tified.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case on each of the two lymph nodes.  

Immunostains show many CD20+ B cells in follicles and scattered in the interfollicular area, and numerous interfollicular T cells (CD3+).
  Scattered plasma cells are polytypic with in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains.  Most plasma cells are IgG+, but very few plasma cells are IgG4+.  Germinal center B cells are negative for bcl-2 and most are Ki-67+ (prol
iferation). There are occasional small and rare large cells that are positive with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  A stain for HHV8 is negative. 

Flow cytometry analysis shows no abnormal B or T-cell population.

In summar
y the findings are consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.  The histologic features are unusual. The appearance of the follicles is reminiscent of those seen in Castleman's disease, although otherwise the specimens do not have the appearance of Cas
tleman's disease. The histologic features are not typical for lupus lymphadenitis which is often a necrotizing lymphadenitis with many immunoblasts. Other patterns of hyperplasia can be seen less commonly with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Flow cytometry (see below) shows no abnormal B or T-cell population.  Immunostains show
 staining of follicles and monocytoid B cells with CD20.  There are many interfollicular T cell
s (CD3+).  CD30 highlights scattered medium-sized and large cells. Lymphoid cells are negative for CD15.  An immunostain for cytomegalovirus is negative.  No atypical cells are detected with cytokeratin cocktail (AE1, 3; Cam5.2).  In-situ hybridization fo
r kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains highlights scattered polytypic plasma cells.

Overall, the findings are most consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia; however, they are somewhat atypical, and if clinically indicated, excision of the lymph node could be considered.

418,S12-7395,Final Diagnosis,"A.  SOFT TISSUE EXCISION, NECK MASS:  
Lymph nodes with low grade B-cell lymphoma, consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma, (see note).

Note:  The specimen consists of lymph node(s) almost entirely replaced by a diffuse proliferation of small lymphocytes with scattered small 
and large ill-defined proliferation centers (pseudofollicles) containing larger cells.  Some sinuses are patent and even dilated, but they are filled by small lymphocytes. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Flow cytometry demonstrates a monotypic B-cell population.  

Immunostains show that most cells are CD19+, CD20 B cells co-expressing CD43.  There are many admixed CD5+ cells but these appear to be T cells, and B cells appear mostly negative for CD5.  Lymphoid c
ells are negative for cyclin D1. With in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains, a few scattered polytypic plasma cells are seen.

The findings are consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma (tissue involvement by neoplastic B 
cells with the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia), although the lack of CD5 expression on many of the B cells is unusual. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count on a recent CBC was 4330 cell per cubic mm, which is not sufficient for a diagn
osis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  It would be of interest to perform flow cytometry on peripheral blood to determine whether a clonal B-cell population can be detected
, and to quantitate the abnormal B-cell population, if present.

Follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern, grade 3A (10%). 
Follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern, grade 1 to 2 of 3 (90%).
Note: The specimen is a nodule of tissue,
 likely a lymph node, replaced by an atypical lymphoid proliferation which invades adjacent fibroadipose tissue. There is a proliferation of centrocytes and scattered centroblasts in poorly delineated follicles
. Unusual features include frequent mitotic figures and the presence of many centrocytes with fine chromatin, imparting a blastic appearance. There are on average 12 centroblasts per HPF consistent with follicular lymphoma, grade 1 to 2 of 3. Focally, however, centroblasts are more numerous (24 per HPF) consistent with follicular lymphoma, grade 3A. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. Flow cytometry (below) shows a monotypic lambda+ B-cell population. 
Immunostains show numerous CD20+ B cells predominantly in a follicular pattern, with many CD3+,
 CD5+ T cells in an interfollicular and diffuse pattern. B cells appear negative for CD5 and positive for bcl6 and bcl
2 (overall dim). CD21 highlights dendritic meshworks in most areas. The % of cells staining with Ki67 (proliferation) is variable but on average approximately 50% of cells in follicles are positi
ve, including areas of grade 1 to 2 follicular lymphoma. An immunostain for cyclin D1 is negative. 

The findings are thus consistent with follicular lymphoma, grade 3A (focal) with the majority of the tissue occupied by low grade follicular lymphoma with a high proliferation index. Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed this unusual case and agrees.

Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (see note).  
NOTE:  The specimen is an enlarged lymph node that is mostly replaced by a vaguely nodular proliferation of small lymphocytes and small clusters and larger aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes with few scattered
 large atypical cells with large, round, indented or lobated nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Some have inclusion-like red nucleoli.  Rare binucleated large cells and rare mummified cells are seen.  A few residual reactive follicles are 
present.  Focally, clusters of germinal center cells are seen in the large, poorly delineated lymphohistiocytic nodules.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  There is a suggestion of early fibrous band formation i
n areas.  Flow cytometry shows no abnormal B-cell or T-cell population.  
Immunostains show CD20+ B cells mainly in relatively small follicles with a few large and scattered small B cells outside follicles.  There are numerous T cells (CD3+) in the expanded interfollicular area.  PD-1 stains scattered T cells brightly in follicle centers, and stains scattered cells, usually more dimly, outside follicles.  PD-1+ rosettes are not conspicuous.  Large atypical cells are CD30+, CD15+ (subset), and at least some 
are CD20+.  They are negative for OCT-2 (although the stain is pale).  Some appear positive for BOB1, 
and at least a few are negative for BOB-1.  They are negative with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  CD21 highlights orderly and occasionally slightly irregular and expanded dendritic meshworks.  
The findings are 
consistent with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.  With respect to subtype, the presence of possible early fibrous band formation suggests nodular sclerosis classical 
Hodgkin's lymphoma, but in the absence of well-formed fibrous bands, because of the lymphocyte and histiocyte-rich background and near-total absence of granulocytes, the differential includes lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Note: The lymph node shows follicular hyperplasia, sinus histocytosis, and perinodal and focal intranodal fibrosis.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case; flow cytometry shows no abnormal B or T-cell population.

B.  LEFT PARA-AORTIC TISSUE:  
Fibroadipose tissue with fibrosis and aggregates of lymphoid cells with reactive follicles and few plasma cells. 

Note: Immunostains on block B2 show many CD20+ B cells, almost entirely confined to follicles. T cells (CD3+) are  present around and within follicles.  Scattered plasma cells, present mainly around the periphery of the follicles, are polytypic with in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains; many of them are IgG+ but only a few are IgG4+.  

The findings are consistent with reactive lymphoid tissue, albeit with few IgG4+ plasma cells. The fibrosis is less cellular and proliferative appearing than is typical for IgG4- related disease; also absent are
 storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis.  The histologic features are not specific, but in the appropriate clinical and radiologic context, could be seen in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.  Drs. Vikram Deshpande and James Stone have reviewed r
epresentative slides and agree with this interpretation.

NOTE:  The specimen is a markedly enlarged lymph node that is replaced by a proliferation of crowded, poorly delineated follicles composed of centrocytes and a few centroblasts.  Occasion
al mitoses are seen in follicles.  Atypical follicles invade into and through the capsule, where they are associated with splitting and duplication of the capsule, with sclerosis around follicles.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunostains
 show that most cells are CD20+ B cells in a follicular pattern; B cells are also present in the interfollicular area.  CD3 and CD5 highlight many interfollicular T cells.  B cells are negative for CD5.  Most are BCL6+.  M
ost but not all are BCL2+.  Within the large follicles there are small, discrete clusters of BCL6+ B cells
 that are negative for BCL2, while surrounding B cells are BCL6+/-, BCL2+.  Ki-67 stains most cells in the BCL2-negative B-cell clusters, and is low outside the clusters.  Overall the proliferation index within follicles is slightly higher than usual for a low-grade 
follicular lymphoma.  Despite the BCL2 negativity and high Ki-67, these clusters morphologically appear to be part of the follicular lymphoma and not residual reactive germinal centers.  
The findings are 
consistent with follicular lymphoma,

Markedly hypocellular marrow with chemotherapy effect (see note.)
NOTE:
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 5%.  
There is abundant interstitial eosinophilic material consistent with chemotherapy effect; the scant cellularity consists predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.  Normal hematopoietic elements are m
arkedly decreased.  There are occasional cells with indented nuclei, pi
nk cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, possibly representing left-shifted myeloid elements.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, but paucicellular.  
A 200 cell count reveals: 6% neutrophils and precursors; 4% erythroid precursors; 65% lymphocytes; 16% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 3% promyelocytes; 3% blasts; and 2% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small but is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40%.  Normal hematopoietic elements are decreased.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased. Myeloid maturation is
 complete, but normal myeloid elements are infrequent.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased with overal
l normal morphology. Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in large infiltrative clusters; they are mostly large atypical forms 
and comprise about 50% of the cellularity.  
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Also seen is prominent paratrabecular fibrosis, without conspicuous osteoclastic activity.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A

Summary: The findings are consistent with plasma cell myeloma. Stains are in process to characterize the neoplastic plasma cells further.  Because of the apparent 
finding of 4% blasts by flow cytometry and paratrabecular fibrosis, additional immunostains will be performed to investigate
 the possibility of increased blasts and to exclude a mast cell proliferation.  Results will be reported upon in an addendum.

Myeloid maturation is complete but is shifted to the left.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased and occur in
 frequent small clusters.  The megakaryocytes include both small forms with small hypolobated
 nuclei and normal-sized to large forms with hyperchromatic nuclei, as well as occasional normal-appearing forms.  
No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Reticulin stai
n shows 3+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  A stain for iron on the decalcified marrow core is negative.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal no increase in CD34+ blasts.  CD117 highlights 
scattered and clustered cells
, likely including some early erythroid forms (approximately 5% of all cells).  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, although many ""naked nuclei"" are seen.  A 200-cell count reveals: 57% neutr
ophils and precursors, 31% erythroid precursors, 2% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 2% basophils, 6% promyelocytes, 1% blasts, and 0% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is left-shifted.  Erythroid maturation is normal, with occasional nuclear bud
ding and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear atypical.

 0% eos;  and 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals leukocytosis with numerous mature neutrophils, some of which appear slightly hypogranulated, and few left-shifted forms.  Some platelets are large.  A few tear-drop cells are seen.  
SU
MMARY:  The findings are consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, but it is difficult to subclassify.  Given the long history of cytopenias and the recent onset of leukocytosis, it is uncertain whether the findings in this specimen represent evolution of a chro
nic disorder or represent a de novo disease.  Some features are suspicious for primary myelofibrosis, although many of the megakaryocytes are not as atypical as characteristically seen in myelofibrosis, and instead have morphology similar to that seen wit
h myelodysplastic syndrome.  Overall, this unusual process is most consistent with a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable.  There is no evidence of 
acute myeloid leukemia.  Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed this case, and agrees.  See also results of flow cytometry on peripheral blood (F12-393).

Hypercellular marrow with involvement by plasma cell myeloma (see note).  
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic but adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%.  The
 myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased, with overall normal morphology, and occur in small clusters.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells and in small clusters.  They consist of mostly atypical forms with small but distinct
 nucleoli and pale cytoplasm, and comprise about 30% of the cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation
 of this case.  Multiple vascular sinusoids are dilated.  Bony trabeculae show remodeling.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 24% neutrophils and precursors, 10% erythroid precursors, 1% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 
2% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 57% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal, except for occasional nuclear budding.  
Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  The plasma cells are medium-sized with nuclear lobation and irregularities, occasional multinucleation, and prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles in pale cytoplasm.

     INTERPRETATION:
     Nine of 20 metaphases contained a translocation of chromosomes 14 and 18.  This
     translocation is associated with an IGH-BCL2 rearrangement. In addition, these
     nine metaphases showed a translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 13, which
     ultimately resulted in a 13q deletion (see below).
     
     FISH evaluation for a 13q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D13S319/
     LSI13q34 Dual Color Probe Set (Abbott Molecular) for the D13S319 at 13q14.3 and
     the LSI13q34 at 13q34 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL. One D13S319 hybridization
     signal was observed in 5/5 abnormal metaphases.
     
     NOTE:  Pathologic analysis (see S12-12389) indicates the presence of two
     low-grade B-cell neoplasms (hairy cell leukemia and CLL). Together, the
     karyotype and FISH analyses performed here are more suggestive of CLL (i.e.,
     13q deletion and t(14;18). 13q is a characteristic finding in CLL and the
     t(14;18) occurs in a subset of CLL)."

520,S12-12389,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW (LEFT ILIAC CREST)
, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE, AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Slightly hypocellular marrow with involvement by:
-  Hairy cell leukemia (approximately 60% of cellularity);
-  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (approximately 10% of cellularity) (see note).  
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen
 contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 10-20%.  
Normal hematopoietic elements are present but decreased.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is 
decreased
.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate, 
with overall normal morphology.  The megakaryocytes include occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei.  
There are scattered non-paratrabecula
r aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclei with condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm.  The small lymphoid cells in aggregates account for 10% of the marrow cellularity and occupy <5% of the intertrabecular marrow space.  Also p
r
esent is an extensive interstitial infiltrate of small to medium-sized cells with oval nuclei, smooth chromatin, and scant to moderate pale cytoplasm.  The interstitial lymphoid cells account for about 60% of all cells, and fill about 10% of the marrow sp
ace.  Plasma cells occur as singly scattered cells.  They consist of mature forms.  A few contain Russell bodies.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining in the lymphoid aggregates and in the interstitial lymphoid infiltrates.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that the interstitial infiltrate is composed of CD20+, CD19+, CD5-, CD25dim B cells, consistent with
 hairy cell leukemia.  The aggregates are CD19+, CD20dim/-, CD5+, consistent with
 chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Thus, involvement by hairy cell leukemia is more extensive than involvement by 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveal
s: 3% neutrophils and precursors, 37% erythroid precursors, 56% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid 
elements are decreased but maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is complete, with occasional nuclear budding and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  Many of the lymphocytes are small, with condensed chromatin and minimal cytoplasm.  A subset is larger, with more oval to bean-shaped nuclei, more ope
n chromatin, and more abundant pale cytoplasm with ruffles or short villi.  
CBC results from 2-26-12 are as follows: WBC 3.3; HGB 10.1; HCT 29.9%; MCV 96 fl; PLT 282.  Manual differential:  6% polys;
 2% bands; 90% lymphs; 0% monos; 2% eos;  and 0% basos.
  Review of the peripheral smear reveals numerous lymphoid cells which are both small and medium-sized.  The medium-sized cells have round nuclei with a moderate amount of pale cytoplasm.  
SUMMARY:  The findings indicate marrow involvement by two low-grade B-cell neoplasms: (1) hairy cell leukemia, involving the marrow in an interstitial pattern, and (2) B-cell lymphoma with the morphology and the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, involving the marrow in a nodular pattern.  The hairy cell leukemia is more extensive than the 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like population.  Of note, the quantity of B cells with immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not sufficient for a primary diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and would now
 be classified as monoclonal B lymphocytosis.  At initial diagnosis in 2001, the patient was leukopenic, and the quantity of lymphocytes would not have fulfilled criteria for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Clinical correlation is required to determine whe
ther the patient's lymphocyte count ever was sufficient for a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Fathi.  See also results of flow cytometry below, which shows 2 clonal B-cell populations; the hairy cell leukemia
 population is under-represented in the sample for flow cytometry, likely because of sampling artifact due to increased reticulin.  Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12-M01368).  
This immunoperoxidase test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the pathology department at the 
Massachusetts General Hospital. It has not been cleared or approved by the 
U.S. food and drug administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary; this laboratory
 has established and verified the test's accuracy and precision.  Selected markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry as well as flow cytometry to assess their expression in the context of the tissue architecture."

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic but is 
adequate for evaluation. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 decreased. Myeloid maturation is complete. Erythroid maturation is
 complete. 
Megakaryocytes are increased. The megakaryocytes include
 occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei. Few ""naked"" nuclei are seen. 
Plasma cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms and comprise about 5-10% of the cellularity. In one area, there is a prominent histiocytic infiltrate with interspersed 
lymphocytes and plasma cells and few scattered la
rge atypical cells, some with prominent nucleoli, including rare binucleated forms, occupying approximately 10% of the marrow space. There are small foci of fibrin deposition, possibly representing early necrosis. 

Immunohistochemical stains of the core b
iopsy reveal the few large atypical cells are positive for CD30, CD15 (granular cytoplasmic
 staining), PAX5 and EBV, using in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER)
. They are negative for CD20 and CD3. The admixed small lymphocytes include a few CD20+ B cells and many CD3+ T cells. Stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi are negative. 

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. 
A 200 cell count reveals: 38% neutrophils and precursors; 28% erythroid precursors; 8% lymphocytes; 3% monocytes; 5% eosinophils; 3% basophils; 1% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 13% plasma cells.

Review of the peripheral smear reveals leukopenia. Few neutrophils have cytoplasmic vacuoles. Platelets exhibit clumping. 

SUMMARY:  The

     INTERPRETATION:
     Chromosome morphology was extremely poor making resolution of any abnormalities
     difficult. Only 7 metaphases were available for analysis. There are appears to
     be deletion on 5p and 7q, and several unidentifiable marker chromosomes. FISH
     analysis, described below, confirms a deletion of 7q in a majority of cells,
     consistent with a diagnosis of MDS.

     FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with a panel of Abbott
     Molecular probes, including Vysis LSI D7S486/CEP 7 Dual Color Probe for D7S486
     at 7q31 and D7Z1 (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is
     interpreted as ABNORMAL.  One D7S486 hybridization signal was observed in
     76/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 5%) established for this
     probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at BWH.
     
     FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with a panel of Abbott

     EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and is interpreted as NORMAL.  One EGR1
     hybridization signal was observed in 3/100 nuclei, which is within the normal
     range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at BWH.  Up to
     3% of cells in normal samples can show apparent 5q deletion using this probe
     set.  A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from absence of a 5q deletion, from
     a 5q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes,
     or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen."

Hypercellular, erythroid-predominant marrow with features consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, suspicious for myelodysplastic syndrome (see note). 
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic and partly 
crushed but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen
 contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete but is shifted to the left.  Myeloid elements appear decreased
.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate
 in number.  The megakaryocytes include frequent atypical, small forms with dark, hypolobated
 nuclei.  There are rare non-paratrabecular aggregates o
f small lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclei.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ to 3+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal staining 
of approximately 5-10% of the cellularity for CD117 (likely including some early erythroid elements) and rare CD34+ blasts.  An iron stain on the core biopsy reveals scant iron stores; no ringed sideroblasts are seen.  
The touch prep slide is paucicellula
r, with frequent stripped nuclei.  A 200-cell count reveals: 17% neutrophils and precursors, 63% erythroid precursors, 10% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 4% blasts, and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is le
ft-shifted and shows occasional hypogranulation.  Erythroid maturation is mildly dysplastic with occasional nuclear budding and irregularities, late mitoses, and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are abnormal, with small, hypolobated forms.  The blasts are smal
l to medium-sized, with round to irregular nuclei with fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm.  
CBC results from 2-27-12 are as follows: WBC 3.3; HGB 9.2; HCT 28.7%; MCV 89 fl; PLT 36.  Manual differential:  42% polys;  1% bands, 1% meta
myelocytes; 48% lymphs;  1% atypical lymphs; 2% monos; 5% eos;  0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals pancytopenia.  There are mature leukocytes with few hypogranulated neutrophils.  Few large cells with nucleoli, which may represent reactive lymphs, are seen; also seen are rare cells that may represent blasts.  

SUMMARY:  Overall, the findings of atypical megakaryocytes and erythroids without a substantial increase in the number of blasts (4%) are suspicious for myelodysplastic syndrome, best-
classified as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.  The presence of reticulin fibrosis and some large, dark megakaryocytes is unusual for myelodysplastic syndrome, however, and suggests that a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm overla
p be considered in the differential diagnosis.  Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12-G01407).

Plasma cell neoplasm (See note.)
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small,
 fragmented and hemorrhagic.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is
 complete. Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are
 adequate with overall normal morphology.   Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small clusters.  They include
 mature and atypical forms with small nucleoli and comprise about 10% of the cellularity. 
By immunohistochemistry for CD138 and in situ hybridization
 for kappa and lambda, the plasma cells are CD138+ and exhibit monotypic expression of kappa light chain.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that the plasma cells are positive for CD56 and show no definite staining for cyclin D1.
  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

Hypercellular, myeloid predominant marrow with unusual features. (See note).
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%. 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is markedly increased. Myeloid maturation is
 shifted to the left but complete. Erythroids are very rare. 
Megakaryocytes are decreased. The myeloid cells are present in sh
eets. Different stages of maturation are present. Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. 
A 200 cell count reveals: 82
% neutrophils and precursors; 3% erythroid precursors; 9% lymphocytes; 1% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 4% blasts; and 1% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is left-shifted and is atypical with numerous cells with round or inden
ted nuclei, and abundant, heavily granulated cytoplasm. 
Erythroid maturation is not evaluable. Few megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.

Review of the peripheral smear reveals mature neutrophils, including
 a few hypogranulated forms, and left shifted atypical granulocytes, some with abundant granula
ted cytoplasm as seen in the marrow, and a few blasts with ovoid nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and basophilic cytoplasm. 
SUMMARY: Compared to the previous bone marrow sample in this patient (S12-9932), the current sample shows more of a myeloid predominanc
e, with marked decrease in erythroids, as well as better maturation of myeloid elements with fewer blasts. The maturing myeloid forms have unusual, atypical morphology with abundant, often hypergranulated cytoplasm. This may represent an unusual manifesta
tion of regeneration, possibly related to growth factor therapy, but the possibility of a clonal relationship to the prior 
acute myeloid leukemia, with maturation of the leukemic clone, cannot be excluded. See also results of flow cytometry below, which show 4% myeloid blasts.

Slightly hypercellular marrow with megakaryocytic, erythroid, and myeloid atypia consistent with persistent myelodysplastic syndrome.  (See note.)
NOTE:
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic, but is adequate for evaluation.  The
 bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.  Myeloid maturation is focally complete, but shifted to the left.  The left-shifted myeloid element
s are medium-sized to large, with prominent nuclear irregularities and occasional prominent nucleoli.  Some eosinophils and their precursors appear enlarged with abundant granules.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes appear
 adequate in number.  
The megakaryocytes include occasional atypical small forms with hypolobated nuclei, as well as occasional morphologically normal forms.  
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that approximately 5-10% of the cellularity is CD34+ and 10% is CD117+.  The majority of the cells are MPO+ Lysozyme+ myeloid
 elements. CD68 stains scattered monocytes/histiocytes.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, but paucicellular.  
A 200 cell count reveals: 37% neutrophils and precursors; 14% erythroid precursors; 10% lymphocytes; 14% monocytes; 5% eosinophils; 3% basophils; 7% promyelocytes; 2% promonos; 8% blasts; and 
< 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted and shows occasional hypogranulation, nuclear hypersegmentation and retained primary granules.  
Erythroid maturation is dysplastic with nuclear irregularities, late mitoses, and binucleation.  Megakary
ocytes are present and appear normal.  The blasts are medium-sized with round to irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli and moderately abundant basophilic cytoplasm with rare granules.  
CBC results from 2/29/2012 are as follows: WBC 3.9; HG
B 9.7; HCT 28.5%; MCV 101 fl; PLT 78.  Manual differential: 16% polys; 3% blasts; 67% lymphs; 2% atypical lymphs; 12% monos; 0% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals few medium-sized to large cells suspicious for blasts with irregular nuc
lei, fine chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm.  

SUMMARY:  Compared to the prior bone marrow biopsy (S12-5646), the atypia of the megakaryocytes persists, and the blast percentage has not increased based on staining for CD34 and CD117. A
typia is also present in the myeloid and erythroid lineages.  These findings are consistent with persistent 
myelodysplastic syndrome.  However, the appearance of the left-shifted myelomonocytic elements is quite unusual and atypical.  Whether this
 change represents progression of disease or the effect of therapy is uncertain.  Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed this case and agrees.  
See also results of flow cytometry below, which show 2% myeloid blasts; blasts may be underrepresented in this spe
cimen because of hemodilution.

617,S12-13362,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, RIGHT ILIAC CREST, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE, AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
- Slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and slight plasmacytosis. 
- There is no morphologic evidence of marrow involvement by lymphoma, (see note).

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%. 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is slightly increased. Myeloid maturation is complete. Erythroid maturation is complete. Megakaryocytes are adequate with overall norma
l morphology. No lymphoid aggregates are seen. Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small clusters. They consist of mature forms and comprise about 5-10% of the cellularity. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

635,S12-13513,Final Diagnosis,"A.  RIGHT EUSTACHIAN TUBE MASS, BIOPSY:  
Small lymphoid cell proliferation.  (See note.)

Note:  The specimen consists of multiple superficial fragments of squamous epithelium and fibrous tissue with a dense lymphoid infiltrate composed predominantly of small, mature-appearing
 lymphocytes with occasional admixed plasma cells, immunoblasts and histiocytes and rare eosinophils.  One of the fragments of fibrous tissue has relatively more neutrophils and eosinophils.  Immunohistochemical stains reveal an admixture of CD20+ B cells
 
and CD3+, CD5+ T cells in nearly equal proportion.  Co-expression of CD5 by B cells is difficult to evaluate because of the large number of admixed T cells.  The findings are overall most consistent with reactive lymphoid tissue, but the small superficial
 nature of the biopsy somewhat limits interpretation. 

B.  RIGHT EUSTACHIAN TUBE MASS #2, BIOPSY:  
Lymphoid tissue with changes consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.  (See note.)

Note:  The specimen consists of squamous mucosa with crypt-like epithelial invaginations, a dense lymphoid infiltrate, and underlying sclerotic fibrous tissue.  The lymphoid infiltrate is composed predominantly of 
small, mature-appearing lymphocytes with occasional admixed plasma cells, immunoblasts, and reactive-appearing follicles.

Immunohistochemical stains show admixture of CD20+ B cells and CD3+ cells in nearly equal proportion.  The T cells are positive for CD5 and Cd43, while the B cells are negative for these markers.  S
tains for kappa and lambda light chains label polytypi
c plasma cells, although evaluation is limited by high background staining.  A CD21 stain shows scattered follicular dendritic cell meshworks.  The findings are consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.  If the mass persists, rebiopsy to obtain tissu

Follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern, grade 1-2 of 3 (see note).

Note:  The specimen is an enlarged lymph node with a proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphoid follicles.  The follicles are poorly demarcated with indistinct to absent mantle zones.
  The follicle centers contain mostly small centrocytes with angular nuclei, coarsely granular chromatin, and small nucleoli. There are occasional admixed large cells with round nuclei, dispersed chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytopla
sm, consistent with centroblasts. There are fewer than 15 centroblasts per high-power field.  Flow cytometric analysis shows a clonal B cell population in a reactive background (see below).

Immunohistochemical stains show that the follicle center cells are positive fo
r CD20, CD10, and Bcl-6, with coexpression of Bcl-2 by many but not all follicle center B cells.  CD21 highlights intact follicular dendritic cell meshworks.  CD3 labels abundant paracortical and follicular T cells. The Ki-67 labeling index is variable, b
u
t is on average 30 to 40% in follicles. The proliferation index is higher than is typically seen in low-grade follicular lymphoma, suggesting the possibility of low-grade follicular lymphoma with a high proliferation index, which may be associated with ag
gressive behavior relative to typical low-grade follicular lymphoma.

Plasma cell myeloma (see note).  
NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50% (Range: 10% to 70%).  The myeloid to erythroid ratio decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate, with overall normal morphology.  There are scattered non-paratrabecular aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round nuclei.  A few clusters of lympho
id cells have slightly enlarged, irregular nuclei and may correspond to hematogones.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells and in small clusters.  They consist of mature forms, and comprise about 15% of the cellularity.  
By immunohistochemistry for CD138 and in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda, the plasma cells are CD138+ and exhibit monotypic expression of light chains.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
  Immunohistochemistry for CD138 highlights the plasma cell population, which is negative for CD56 and Cyclin-D1, and demonstrates positive staining for kappa in-situ hybridization, and negative staining for lambda in-situ hybridization.  
The aspirate sm
ear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute.  A 200-cell count reveals: 46% neutrophils and precursors, 16% erythroid precursors, 11% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 2% promyelocytes, 1% blasts, and 15% plasma cells.  Myeloid ma
turation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal.  Plasma cells are mostly small and mature but sometimes lack a discrete Golgi.  Few binucleated forms are seen.  A few cells counted as lymphs have morphology suggestive of hematogones.

Acute myeloid leukemia.

Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and partly crushed, but is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50% (range 40-60%).  Normal hematopoietic elements
 are markedly decreased.  Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in large infiltrative clusters and she
ets and comprise approximately 70% of the cellularity.  The blasts are medium-sized with round, irregular or indented
 nuclei, prominent 
nucleoli and scant  cytoplasm.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells.   Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, but hemodilute.  
A 200-cell count reveals: 6% neutrophils and precursors; 9% erythroid precursors; 6% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 3% promyelocytes; 71% blasts; and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is markedly left-shifted.  Too few maturing 
myeloid elements are present to evaluate presence of dysplasia.  Erythroid maturation is normal based on small numbers of normal elements present.  Megakaryocytes are absent.  The aspirate reveals numerous medium-sized cells with ov
oid, slightly irregular nuclei containing dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli and scant agranular cytoplasm, consistent with blasts.
CBC results from 3/9/2012 are as follows: WBC 4.1; HGB 9.3; HCT 26.9%; MCV 96 fl; PLT 107.  Manual differential (fr
om 3/10/2012): 14% polys; 6% bands; 54% lymphs; 1% atypical lymphs; 7% monos; 4% eos; 0% basos; 14% other WBCs (suspicious for blasts).  Review of the peripheral smear reveals monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes.  There are also frequent abnormal medium-sized mononuclear cells with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli consistent with blasts.  The blasts in the peripheral blood show somewhat more nuclear irregularity than in the marrow.
SUMMARY:  The presence of numerous blasts in the bone 
marrow and frequent blasts in peripheral blood, together with the results of
 flow cytometry (below) are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia.

Subclassification of this acute leukemia according to the WHO Classification is pending results of cytogenetics (CG12-K01702) and will be reported in an addendum."

Variably cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis with relative erythroid hyperplasia with a leftward shift.  

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40-50% (range 5 to 75%).  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 reversed.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  
Erythroid maturation is complete but shifted to the left.  Megakaryocytes are
 adequate in number.  The megakaryocytes include occasional normal forms, as well as forms with hypolobated and/or bulbous nuclei.  There are several non-paratrabecular aggregates
 of small lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclei.  The lymphoid cells account for 5
% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 3% of the intertrabecular marrow space.
  Plasma cells occur as occasional scattered cells.  They consist of mature forms.  Reticulin stain shows 1 to 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa sta
in was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Occasional singly scattered, normally granulated mast cells are present and focally they appear slightly increased.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 500-cell count reve
als: 28% neutrophils and precursors; 29% erythroid precursors; 32% lymphocytes; 5% monocytes; 2% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 2% promyelocytes; 1% blast
s; and 1% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is complete.  
Erythroid maturation is left-shifted and shows oc
casional nuclear irregularities, frequent late mitoses and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present
.  Lymphocytes are increased and consist of predominantly small, mature-appearing cells with occasional large granular lymphocytes.  

CBC results from 3/12
/12 are as follows: WBC 4.0; HGB 11.7; HCT 34.4%; MCV 104 fl; PLT 48.  Manual differential: 49% polys; 41% lymphs; 3% atypical lymphs; 6% monos; 1
% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals that the 
""atypical lymphocytes"" are small with round nuclei, condensed chromatin, single distinct nucleoli and scant to moderately abundant bas
ophilic cytoplasm, most consistent with reactive lymphocytes.  Occasional large granular lymphocytes are also present.  Neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes are unremarkable.  

SUMMARY:  Compared to the most recent prior marrow, the cellularity in the core biopsy is much improved, although this may be due at least in part to sampling artifact
.  The findings in this specimen are most consistent with reactive/regenerative marrow.  Clinical correlation and follow-up are recommended.

788,S12-16798,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, ILIAC CREST, SIDE NOT SPECIFIED, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:  
Acute myeloid leukemia.

NOTE:

The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 95%.  
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.  Most cells present are immature myelomonocytic elements with round, indented, folded or lobated nuclei and scant to moderately
 abundant pink cytoplasm, present in sheets.  Eosinophils appear increased in areas.  
Reticulin stain shows 1 to 2
+ (out of 4) fiber staining. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute.  
The touch pre
p slide is adequate for evaluation.  A 200 cell count reveals: 38% neutrophils and precursors; 2% erythroid precursors; 9% lymphocytes; 0% monocytes; 4% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 7% promyelocytes; 38% blasts; and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is m
arkedly dysplastic with abnormal nuclear lobation and hypogranulation.  Occasional cells with both eosinophil and basophil granules are seen.  Erythroid maturation is not evaluable.  Megakaryocytes are markedly decreased.  There are immature myelomonocytic 
blasts containing fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, large lobulated, occasionally folded nuclei and scant to moderate basophilic cytoplasm with rare Auer rods.  Occasional blasts have coarse dark blue granules or rarely 
unusual crystalline dark blue granules.

CBC results from 3/14/12 are as follows: WBC 15.4; HGB 5.0; HCT 13.3%; MCV 113 fl; PLT 12.  

Manual differential: 24% polys; 25% lymphs; 8% monos; 3% eos; 0% basos; 40% other WBCs (consistent with blasts).  Review of the peripheral smear reveals large mononuclear cells with prominent nucleoli and scant basophilic cytoplasm
, consistent with blasts and with similar morphology to the myeloid blasts seen in the bone marrow biopsy.  There are also markedly decreased platelets and RBCs.

SUMMARY:  Review of the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate reveals an abnormal infiltrate of blasts with myelomono
cytic features.  There are also occasional maturing myeloid cells with eosinophilic and some basophilic cytoplasmic granules.  These findings are diagnostic of acu
te myeloid leukemia.  In a patient previously treated for lymphoma, this is consistent with a therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia; however, some features raise the question of acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) showing abnormal marrow eosinophilia.  Su
bclassification of this acute leukemia according to the WHO Classification is pending results of cytogenetics (CG-12-X01884) and will be reported in an addendum.  See also results of flow cytometry below, which show 34% myeloid blasts."

C.  THYROID, ISTHMUS AND PYRAMIDAL LOBE, EXCISION:

Note:  Within the thyroid parenchyma there is abundant organized lymphoid tissue with reactive hyperplasia, with prominent follicular hyperplasia.  A few follicles show 
progressive transformation of germinal centers
.  Rare follicles are surrounded by small clusters of epithelioid histiocytes.  Focally (best seen in A1) a dilated duct lined by squamoid epithelium runs through the center of the lymphoid tissue.  
Flow cytometry (below) shows no abnormal lymphoid population.  Immunostains on specimens A and B show many CD19+, CD20+ B cells in a follicular pattern and many interfollicular T cells (CD3+, CD5+, CD43+).  B cells appear negative for CD5 
and CD43.  Follicle centers bcl-2-, CD10+, bcl-6+, with most cells Ki67+.  In-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains
 highlights many polytypic plasma cells, many of which are in follicle centers.  The majority of plasma cells are IgG+.  More than 50%
 of the plasma cells are IgG4+.  IgM stains follicles and stains occasional plasma cells.  IgD stains follicle mantles.  With antibody to cytokeratin, thyroid follicles and the epithelium of the dilated duct are stained.  
The finding of a large nodule of hyperplastic lymphoid tissue displacing thyroid tissue and forming a mass lesion in the thyroid is very unusual.  However, the findings are not
 suggestive of either lymphoma or a thyroid epithelial neoplasm.  The identification of a duct within the lymphoid tissue raises the possibility of persistent thyroglossal duct, a structure which is sometimes surrounded by lymphoid tissue.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Another unusual finding is the increased number of IgG4+ plasma ce
lls in the lymphoid tissue.  The significance of this finding is uncertain, but if clinically indicated the patient could be evaluated for other manifestations of IgG4- related disease such as sclerosing lesions in extranodal sites and elevated serum IgG4
.

800,S12-18783,Final Diagnosis,"A.  SKIN BIOPSY, RIGHT ABDOMEN:  
Follicular lymphoma (See note.)
NOTE:  The specimen shows a dense dermal and subcutaneous infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells.  The infiltrate is composed of centrocytes with irregular nuclear contours, pale chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli and sm
all, mature-appearing lymphocytes with dense chromatin and some nuclear irregularity.  Focally, toward the center of the lesion in block A2 there are increased numbers of large lymphoid cells (centroblasts).  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  In some areas the infiltrate forms ill-defined follicles that lack polarization and mantle zones.  
Immunostains on blocks A1 and A2 show that the cells of the follicular regions are CD20+, CD10+, bcl2+, bcl6+, CD30- and CD5
-.  CD21 and CD23 highlight multiple dendritic meshworks.  CD3 and CD5 highlight T cells, which showed scattered CD4 and CD8 positivity (CD4>CD8).  In situ hybridization for kappa and lambda demonstrates very rare polytypic plasma cells.  Ki67 (proliferation) stains up to approximately 70% of cells in areas with increased large cells.  
The overall histologic and 
immunophenotypic findings are consistent with cutaneous involvement by follicular lymphoma
, most consistent with spread from the patient's previously diagnosed lymph nodal follicular lymphoma.  Most of the 
follicular lymphoma has the appearance of grade 1 to 2 of 3 follicular lymphoma, but there are areas with increased large cells suggesting grade 3A, accompanied by an elevated 
proliferation index
.  The prior specimen showing lymph node with follicular lymphoma (MS09F33480) has been reviewed for comparison.  Compared to the lymph node, the skin does show an increase in large lymphoid cells focally.  The proliferation index in many follicles in the
 lymph node is low although scattered follicles show a high proliferation
 index, so that there has not been a definite change in proliferation
 index between the two samples.  The changes suggest early histologic progression of the lymphoma, but clinical cor
relation is suggested.  The foci with increased large cells are not completely encompassed by CD21+ or CD23+ dendritic meshworks, but the foci are very small and there are fragmented meshworks in the vicinity, and the findings are not sufficient for large
 cell transformation.

ter for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BL12-W11365). Results are as follows:
DNA was isolated from a paraffin embedded tissue, S12-19628 and analyzed by a 
polymerase chain reaction technique using primers conjugated with fluorescent 
dyes that hybridize to conserved framework (regions 1,2 and 3) and joining 
regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (InVivoScribe Technologies, 
BIOMED, San Diego, CA). The PCR products were analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis.

RESULT:
IgH: Clonal pattern.

A clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement is identified with framework I (334 bp) and framework II (269 bp) primers.  A prominent peak is seen in framework III at 212 bp.

INTERPRETATION:
These findings indicate the presence of a clonal B cell population.

An identical peak is seen in the patient'

836,S12-20069,Addendum,"Cytogenetic analysis (CG12-G02234) showed:

Karyotype: 51-52, XX, +3, +3, add (3) (p21) x2, +5, t (8;14) (q24; q32), +12, -15, +22 (cp10).ish add (3) (BCL2+) x2, t (8;14) (IGH+; IGH+).

Interpretation:
All metaphases contained a translocation of chromosomes 8 a
nd 14.  This translocation is associated with a MYC-IGH rearrangement, and is a characteristic finding in mature B-cell (Burkitt-type) leukemia or lymphoma.

FISH evaluation for IGH-BCL2 rearrangement was performed in nuclei with the Vysis LSI IGH/BCL2 Dua
l Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe (Abbott Molecular) for IGH at 14q32 and BCL2 at 18q21 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL. Although IGH-BCL2 rearrangement was not observed, IGH rearrangement was observed between chromosome 8 and 14, confirming t(8;14)
.  Moreover, additional BCL2 hybridization signals were observed on the add (3p).

Comments:  MYC rearrangements are found in a minority of d
iffuse large B-cell lymphoma; they tend to be associated with aggressive behavior. As no BCL2 rearrangement is found, the findings do no
t support a diagnosis of ""double-hit"" lymphoma, with concurrent rearrangement of MYC and BCL2."

- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic variant.

Note:  The specimen is a markedly enlarged lymph node that is almost entirely replaced by a diffuse proliferation of immunoblasts with large oval nuclei, vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli.  Focally, there is a suggestion of follicle formation by the immunoblasts.  Immunoblasts invade perinodal soft tissue.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the h
istologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunostains show that large atypical lymphoid 
cells are positive for CD20 and bcl-2, and negative for CD5.  There is a very dim, likely non-specific staining for bcl-6.  CD2
1 highlights follicular dendritic meshworks 
associated with aggregates of large cells. There are many scattered admixed small T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD5+).  Ki-67 (proliferation) stains 50 to 60% of cells.  In-situ hybridization (ISH) performed on a paraffin-embedded section reveals no staining with 
an oligonucleotide probe for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER).  There is monotypic cytoplasmic lambda light chain
 staining of some large cells with antibody to kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chain.  Flow cytometric analysis (below) also shows a monotypic lambda+ B-cell population.  
The findings are those of 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma composed almost exclusively of immunoblasts.  Focally the lymphoma has a follicular pattern (follicular lymphoma, grade 3B).

845,S12-20092,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LYMPH NODE EXCISIONAL BIOPSY, RIGHT CERVICAL:  
Atypical 
lymphoid infiltrate (see note).  
NOTE:   The specimen consists of multiple small 
fragments of tissue with differing histologic features.  One fragment is a small lymph node with slight follicular hyperplasia and an inte
rfollicular area with small lymphocytes, many plasma cells, and rare large cells.  Other fragments show a diffuse proliferation of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and rare to scattered large atypical cells with variably prominent interstitial sclerosis.  Large cells with large oval or irregular nuclei with vesicular chromatin
 and large reddish, inclusion-like nucleoli are seen.  Rare large atypical cells are binucleated.  Granulocytes are essentially absent.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Flow cytometry (below) shows no diagnostic abnormality.
Immunostains show that large atypical cells are 
positive for CD20, BCL-6, and MUM-1/IRF-4.  Rare large cells are CD30+, but most appear negative.  Large cells are negative for CD3, CD15, HHV-8, and
 EBER.  CD20 also stains many B cells in follicles, and CD3 stains many small T cells scattered
 throughout the tissue.  Germinal centers are negative for BCL-2.  Follicles are associated with CD21+ dendritic staining.  There is no staining for CMV.  
In summary, the findings are atypical.  Focally they 
are suspicious for lymphoma, but much of the tissue shows non-specific reactive changes not suggesting a neoplasm.  In the atypical areas, the histologic appearance raises the question of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, although the immunophenotype does not support this diagnosis.  The 
differential diagnosis includes T-cell/histiocyte rich large B-cell lymphoma, although this type of lymphoma is not seen with increased frequency with HIV infection, and it is a 
difficult diagnosis to establish on a small piece of tissue.  Another consideration is an atypical reactive process.  Obtaining a larger biopsy specimen could be helpful in establishing a diagnosis.

Atypical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with histiocytes and fibrosis.  
NOTE:  The specimen consists of fragments of fibrous tissue within which are scattered widely separated aggregates of small lymphocytes and few large lymphoid cells, including atypical large cells.  A perifol
licular cuff of marginal zone cells is seen around some aggregates.  Between and around the aggregates is a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells, rare eosinophils and occasional
 large lymphoid cells, in a fibrotic background.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunostains show that the lymphoid aggregates
 are composed of a mixture of CD3+ T cells and CD19+, CD20+, PAX5+ B cells associated with CD21+ follicular dendritic meshworks.  Outside the aggregates
 there is a marked predominance of T cells also with scattered small and large B cells.  CD30 highlights the large cells and a few smaller cells.  A few scattered and loosely clustered plasma cells are CD138+.  Pl
asma cells appear polytypic with  immunostains for kappa and lambda.  Ki67 staining is variable but overall approximately 20% of cells are stained.  There is no staining for HHV8.  CD15 stains scattered granulocytes and few histiocytes.  
The findings are
 atypical and show histiologic and immunophenotypic features that overlap with those seen in the recent prior biopsy (S12-18071).  However, the infiltrate in the current specimen is overall less densely cellular, with more histiocytes and fibrosis; in add

filtrating cells stain with B-cell markers (CD20, CD19, dim CD79a), and are negative for CD5, CD10, and CD23.  CD5 highlights scattered T cells.  No definite H. pylori are identified on an immunostain.  There is focal CD23+ dendritic staining.  B cells app
ear to co-express CD43.  Plasma cells appear polytypic (kappa+, lambda+).  The histologic features in conjunction with results of immunophenotyping are consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; this may represent spread from the patient'
s previously diagnosed small intestinal MALT lymphoma (S12-10968).

898,S12-25094,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LYMPH NODE EXCISIONAL BIOPSY, RIGHT CERVICAL:  
Necrotizing lymphadenitis with features consistent with histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi's disease) with scattered Epstein-Barr virus + cells.  See note.

Note: The specimen is a slightly enlarged lymph node with par
acortical hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis.  Within the paracortex are large, ill-defined, rounded areas of necrosis and apoptotic debris, with admixed immunoblasts and scattered and clustered medium-sized cells consistent with plasmacytoid dendritic ce
lls.  Also present are numerous histiocytes, including many crescentic histiocytes. Neutrophils and eosinophils are essentially absent.  No granuloma formation is seen.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  

Immunohistochemistry demonstrates
 CD20+ B cells, mostly in primary follicles and interspersed paracortical areas of predominantly CD3+ T cells, including both CD4+ and CD8+ with CD4+ T-cells being more abundant overall, and with a more equal mix of CD4 and CD8 T cells in histiocyte-rich areas.  CD123 highlights many plasmacytoid dendritic cells.  In-situ hybridization (ISH) performed on a paraffin-embedded section reveals positive staining of scattered small and large cells with an oligonucleotide probe specific 
for EBV encoded RNA (EBER). GMS and AFB stains are negative for organisms.  There is no evidence of lymphoma.  

Overall, the appearance of the lymph node, including areas of necrosis with numerous histiocytes, taken together with immunohistochemistry is c
onsistent with Kikuchi's disease.  The presence of EBER+ cells raises the question of Epstein-Barr virus infection as a cause of the lymphadenitis although the histologic findings are not typical of those seen in infectious mononucleosis, and the number o
f EBER+ cells is also smaller than usually seen in infectious mononucleosis.  Of note, lymphadenitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus can have features similar to those seen in Kikuch's disease; if clinically indicated work-up for an autoimmune disorder could be undertaken.

his case was submitted to the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BL-12-D12933). Results are as follows:

Pathologist:   Shuji  Ogino, M.D., Ph.D.

RESULT:
IgH: Polyclonal pattern.
A clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement is not identified.
DNA fragments up to 300 bp in length did amplify with the control primers.  The
expected size range for IgH rearrangements is 100 - 400 bp.

TCR: Oligoclonal pattern.
Four peaks were seen in Vgamma 1-8 (214.3 and 239.7 bp) and Vgamma 10 (152.9
and 164.8 164.8 bp).

INTERPRETATION:
No clonal B cell population is identified by this test.

These findings indicate the presence of an oligoclonal T cell population.

Correlation with histologic, immunophenotypic, as well as other laboratory and
clinical findings is suggested.
This technique can detect clonal rearrangements in 85% of B cell lymphomas.
Most B cell lymphoma cases that are negative by this method are follicular or
diffuse large B cell lymphomas with somatic mutations that may impair primer
hybridization (van Dongen JJM et al. Leukemia 2003; 17:2257-2317). Therefore,
this negative result does not completely exclude a B cell lymphoma.

Summary: The results are atypical but they do not provide definite confirmation of a diagnosis of lymphoma."

XCISIONAL BIOPSY, RIGHT AXILLARY:  
Atypical lymphoid proliferation, highly suspicious for lymphoma. 
There is no evidence of metastatic melanoma. 

Note: The specimen is an enlarged lymph node with architecture that is distorted but not obliterated. There are scattered widely 
separated follicles, most lacking well-defined germinal centers. The expanded interfollicular area is occupied by a population of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with oval, slightly irregular or indented nuclei, smooth to stippled chromatin, inconspi
cuous nucleoli and moderately abundant pale cytoplasm, with an admixture of a few large cells, scattered histiocytes and occasional plasma cells. High endothelial venules are prominent. Mitoses are readily identified. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
Immunostains show unusual findings in both follicles and interfollicular areas. Follicles include mantle zones composed predominantly of B cells (CD20+, CD19+, Pax5+) but the germinal centers contain only a minority o
f B cells and a predominance of T cells (CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, CD43+, PD1+, CD4+, with few CD8+). Germinal centers contain many scattered 
CD10+, bcl 6+ cells; these may correspond to B cells but it is difficult to exclude the possibility of their aberrant expression by T cells. CD21 highlights densely stained 
follicular dendritic cell meshworks associated with follicles; meshworks are not expanded. Germinal centers contain a mix of bcl 2+, bcl 2 dim and bcl 2- cells. The interfollicular area contains a mi
xture of many B cells (CD19+, CD20+, Pax5+) and many T cells (CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, with a mix of CD4+ and CD8+). Many T cells are PD1 dim+ (in contrast to bright staining in follicles)
. Scattered interfollicular CD10+, bcl 6+ cells are seen. Plasma cells are polytypic (kappa+, lambda+). In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) shows staining of scattered cells of a range of sizes; they may correspond to B cells, but it is difficult to be certain. MART1 is negative.
The findings ar
e overall highly suspicious for lymphoma, although making a definitive diagnosis is difficult because lymph nodal architecture is not effaced, cytologic atypia is not striking and no diagnostic immunophenotypic abnormality is seen. In addition, it is diff
i
cult to be certain whether, if lymphoma, the changes represent a B or T-cell lymphoma, as there is an admixture of B and T cells throughout the node. The appearance of the interfollicular area suggests a T-cell lymphoma, but the large number of B cells ou
tside follicles is an atypical feature that suggests a B-cell lymphoma. Dr. Nancy Harris has reviewed representative slides from this difficult
 case, and agrees with the diagnosis above. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to assess clonality is pending and will be reported on separately.

957,S12-26388,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, RIGHT ILIAC CREST, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:  
Hypercellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis with mild abnormalities in the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages and borderline increased reticulin fibrosis.  
Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90% (range 80 to 95%) and has a disorganized appearance.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is slightly increased.  
Myeloid maturation is complete, but focally shifted to the left.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete, but focally shifted to the left.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number and include occasional small forms with hyperchromatic nuclei.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Hemosideri
n-laden macrophages are present.   Plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils occur as scattered cells.  Plasma cells tend to be found in a perivascular location.   
Reticulin stain shows 3+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal
 no increase in mast cells on a stain for tryptase.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 59
% neutrophils and precursors; 21%
 erythroid precursors; 14% lymphocytes; 0% monocytes; 3% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 1% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 1

26% monos; 8
% eos; 0% basos.
  Review of the peripheral smear reveals predominantly small mature lymphocytes as well as occasional monocytes and eosinophils.  Mature neutrophils are rare to
 absent.  Platelets are decreased with occasional large forms.
SUMMARY:  The overall findings are of a hypercellular marrow with mild maturation abnormalities in the erythroid lineage, occasional slightly
 atypical megakaryocytes and borderline increased reticulin fibrosis.

In contrast to the previous bone marrow biopsies, no lymphoid aggregates were identified in the current specimen.  In the setting of persistent cytopenia that  are reportedly responsive to immunosuppress
ive therapy, the favored diagnosis is autoimmune myelofibrosis, which can occur in the setting of known autoimmune disease or as a primary bone marrow process.  However, the differential diagnosis also includes an unusual myeloid neoplasm.  While the pres
e
nce of cytopenias (rather than increased peripheral counts) and lack of splenomegaly make a myeloproliferative neoplasm unlikely, molecular studies to rue out a JAK2 mutation may be helpful.  An unusual myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative / myel
odysplastic overlap syndrome is another consideration given the megakaryocyte abnormalities and elevated MCV.  However, the histologic findings are not diagnostic of a myelodysplastic syndrome and peripheral count recovery in response to therapy in the past makes this diagnosis less likely.  
Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed representative slides from this case, and agrees with the diagnosis above.

.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.  Myeloid maturation is markedly shifted to the left, with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are present in roughly normal numbers.  The megakaryocytes include frequent dysplastic, small forms with hypolobated nuclei.  
Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in sheets.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that the CD34+ CD117+ myeloid blasts comprise approximately 30% of the marrow cellularity.  TdT stains few scattered
 cells, but blasts appear overall negative for TdT.  MPO is positive
 in maturing myeloid elements, which comprise about 10% of the cellularity.  CD19 and CD3 reveal scattered
 small B and T cells, respectively.  
The aspirate smear is somewhat
 hemodilute, with some areas with poorly preserved morphology.  The touch prep slide is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count on the touch prep reveals:  6% neutrophils and precursors, 8% erythroid precursors, 3% lymphocytes, 0% monoc
ytes, 1% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 82% blasts, and 0% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted.  Erythroid maturation is not evaluable.  Megakaryocytes are present, with occasional small, hypolobated
 forms.  The blast cells are small to medium-sized with fine chromatin, small nucleoli, and scant agranular cytoplasm.  
CBC results from 4-30-12 are as follows: WBC 2.8; HGB 6.9; HCT 22.1%; 67 fl; MCV PLT 123.  Manual differential:  39% polys; 1% bands; 12% blasts; 31% lymphs; 16% m
onos; 0% eos; 1% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals frequent medium-sized blast forms.  The red blood cells show anisopoikilocytosis and hypochromasia.  
SUMMARY:  The findings support a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.  
Subclassification of this acute leukemia according to the WHO Classification is pending results of cytogenetics (CG-12 E2915) and will be reported in an addendum.

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is fragmented and hemorrhagic and consists largely of cortical bone and periosteum, althoug
h sufficient marrow is present for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen c
ontains adequate marrow particles.
The marrow cellularity is approximately 70% (range 50 to 80%). The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 decreased. Myeloid maturation is complete but shifted to the left. Erythroid maturation is
 complete. Megakaryocytes are increased and occur in small clusters. 
The megakaryocytes include

Markedly hypocellular chemotherapy-ablated marrow (see note).  
NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic and partly crushed but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall <5%.  The marrow contains fat and interstitial eosinophilic material consistent with chemotherapy effect; the scant cellularity consists predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.  No
rmal hematopoietic elements are essentially absent.  Reticulin stain shows 1-2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  There are frequent hemosiderin-laden macrophages
.
The aspirate smear 
is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute and paucicellular.  The touch prep slide is adequate for evaluation but paucicellular.  A 100-cell count reveals: 2% neutrophils and precursors, 4% erythroid precursors, 84% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, 2% blasts, a
nd 6% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation and erythroid maturation are not optimally evaluable.  Megakaryocytes are absent.

Slightly hypercellular marrow with erythroid hyperplasia and monoclonal plasma cells (5%), consistent with involvement by a plasma cell neoplasm.  (See note.)

NOTE:
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megak
aryocytes are adequate with overall normal morphology.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small clusters.  They cons
ist of mostly mature forms and and comprise about 5% of the cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, but hemodilute.  
A 200 cell count reveals: 49% neutrophils and precursors; 17% erythroid precursors; 17% lymphocytes; 5% monocytes; 8% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  
Erythroid maturation is overall normal with rare nuclear budding and irregularities.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  An iron stain demonstrates scant storage iron and no ring sideroblasts.

1126,S12-33332,Addendum,"Cytogenetics on this case (see corresponding report CG12-G03515) revealed an abnormal karyotype:

46,XY, ?del (12) (p12p13) [2] /46, XY [18]

Molecular genetic studies (see corresponding report from Genyme) revealed the presence of an NPM1 exon 12 mutation, no FLT3 ITD mutation, and no FLT3 D835 mutation.  No CEBPA mutation was identified (see report from Lab Corp).

Based on these results in the context of the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings, this leukemia is classified as:

1128,S12-33332,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, LEFT ILIAC CREST, BIOPSY, ASIRATE AND PERIHERAL SMEAR: 
Acute myeloid leukemia. (See note).
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%. Normal he
matopoietic elements are decreased. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased. Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with a paucity of mature forms. Erythroid maturation is complete. Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morphology; howev
e
r, the megakaryocytes include occasional small forms with hypolobated, often single, nuclei. Primitive cells consistent with blasts occur in sheets and comprise approximately 70% of the cellularity. The blasts are medium-sized with irregular,
 indented nuclei, prominent nucleoli and scant to moderate cytoplasm. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. The touch prep slide is
 adequate for evaluation. A 200
 cell count reveals: 18% neutrophils and precursors; 17
% erythroid precursors; 14% lymphocytes; 
1% monocytes; 0
% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 
0% promyelocytes; 49% blasts; and 1
% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is normal.
Erythroid maturation is
 complete with nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear budding and irregularities, binucleation and/or basophilic cytoplasmic stippling, in approximately one-third of erythroid elements. The blasts are medium-sized with round to irregula
r, indented nuclei, dispersed chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant to moderately abundant basophilic cytoplasm with sparse azurophilic granules and occasional Auer rods. 
CBC r
esults from 5/24/12 are as follows: WBC 3.3; HGB 7.9; HCT 23.8%; MCV 105 fl; PLT 77. Manual differential: 52
% polys; 28% lymphs; 1% atypical lymphs; 16% monos;  3% other WBCs.
 Review of the peripheral smear reveals occasional medium-sized blasts with round to irregular, indented nuclei, dispersed chromatin, prominent nucleoli, an
d scant to moderately abundant cytoplasm with sparse azurophilic granules, occasional small vacuoles and occasional Auer rods.  A minority of 
neutrophils appear hypogranular, with pseudo Pelger Huet change.
SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia
 with myelomonocytic features. There is some atypia in the residual hematopoietic elements; however, they are not sufficient for a designation of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-associated changes. Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed representative slides from this case, and agrees with the diagnosis above.

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 95%.  
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morp

1169,S12-33677,Final Diagnosis,"BONE MARROW LEFT ILIAC CREST, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and reactive changes 
(See note.)
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%.  In areas, the marrow architecture appears disorganized. 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased with overall normal morphology and occur in focal small clusters.  The megakaryocytes include
 occasional forms with hyperlobated/complex nuclei.  
No lymphoid aggregates are seen. Plasma cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms and comprise <5% of cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.
  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
  An immunohistochemical stain for CD163 was performed to highlight histocytes; however there is non-specific 
staining of granulocytes and platelets which complicates evaluation of the stain.  There is no convincing evidence of hemophagocytosis on the CD163 stained slide or on the H&E and Giemsa stained slides.
However, there are numerous apoptotic cells and areas of cellular debris with histocytic inflammation, suggestive of marrow injury. 
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  
A 200 cell count reveals: 37% neutrophils and precursors; 17% erythroid precursors; 17% lymphocytes; 25% monocytes; 2% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 2% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is slightly left shifted with relative decrease in mature forms.  Erythroid maturation shows rare late mitoses and binucleation. Megakaryocytes appear normal overall, 
but with occasional forms with complex nuclei.
CBC results from 5/25/12 are as follows: WBC 1.0; HGB 10.2; HCT 31.7%; MCV 69 fl; PLT 151.  Manual differential: 75% polys; 5% bands; 10% lymphs; 10% monos; 0% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear r
eveals leukopenia with otherwise unremarkable leukocytes.  The RBCs show anisocytosis with increased microcytes
, hypochromasia, occasional bite cells and sc
histocytes, and rare elliptocytes. 
Summary:  There are mild alterations to the cellular composition of the marrow, including increased megakaryocytes with complex nuclei, decreased mature granulocytes and focal apoptotic debris.  The megakaryocyte
 morphology is slightly reminiscent of essential thrombocythemia, but in the overall context of this case is more likely to represent a reactive morphological change.  The overall findings are most consistent with autoimmune,
 viral or toxic reaction.  There is no definite evidence of hemophagocytosis. Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

Note:  The specimen consists of small cores of lymph node mostly replaced by a diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells and occasional
 medium-sized atypical cells with round to oval and irregular nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. M
itoses are frequent.  There is interspersed apoptotic debris as well as occasional tingible body macrophages.  Flow cytometry confirms the presence of a clonal B-cell population (below).
Immunostains show that atypical cells are positive for CD20, CD10, BCL6 and MUM1/
IRF4 and negative for CD5 and BCL2.  Ki67 (proliferation) stains 80-90% of cells.  I
n-situ hybridization (ISH) performed on a paraffin-embedded section reveals no staining with an oligonucleotide probe for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER).
The findings are consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with features suggesting high-grade behavior.  The immunophenotype is similar to that seen in Burkitt'
s lymphoma, although the tumor cells in this case are larger and more pleomorphic than is typical of Burkitt's lymphoma.  See also results of cytogenetics (

1207,S12-33846,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR (LEFT ILIAC CREST):  
Mildly hypocellular marrow with relative erythroid hyperplasia and decreased myeloid elements with left-shifted myelopoiesis (see note).  
NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate
 marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 30%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is reversed. Myeloid maturation is 
shifted to the left.  Myeloid elements are decreased.  Erythroid 
maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate in number, with overall normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages
 are present.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 500-cell count reveals: 18% neutrophils and precursors, 71% erythroid precursors, 6% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1%
 promyelocytes, 1% blasts, and 0% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted, with a preponderance of myelocytes and metamyelocytes.  Mature granulocytes are rare.  Erythroid maturation is atypical, with frequent nuclear budding and irregularities, late mitoses, and binucleation.  
Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  An iron stain demonstrates the presence of storage iron and rare possible ringed sideroblasts comprising <5% of all erythroid forms.  
CBC results from 5-25-12 are as follows: WBC 1.1; HGB 12.1; HCT 33.8%; MCV 91 fl; PLT 187.  Manual differential: 44% polys;  7% bands; 2% metamyelocytes; 1% myelocytes; 31% lymphs; 11% monos;
 2% eos;  2% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals occasional monolobated or bilobated neutrophils with normal granulation, and rare nucleated RBCs.  Lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils are also present and appear normal.  
SUMMARY:  The marrow shows relative erythroid hyperplasia, dysplastic-appearing erythroids, and left-shifted mye
lopoiesis, but no increase in blasts.  The findings raise the possibility of a myelodysplastic syndrome, specifically refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.  However, the patient is receiving medications that could potentially affect the marrow
 and explain some or all of these findings.  Also, the relatively acute onset of cytopenias and the low marrow cellularity tend to favor a toxic, viral, or autoimmune etiology.  Dr. Robert Hasserjian has reviewed the slides, and agrees with the diagnosis.
  Correlation with results of cytogenetics (CG-12 J03573) is required.

Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.
There is no definitive evidence of residual plasma cell myeloma.  (See note.)
Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and hemorrhagic but is a
dequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare 
marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50%.  Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear 
adequate in number, with normal morphology.  Plasma cells occur as rare cells. They consist of mature forms and comprise about 1% of the cellularity.  By immunohistochemistry 
for CD138 and in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda, the rare plasma cells are CD138+ and exhibit
 polytypic expression of kappa and lambda light chains.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-

% erythroid precursors; 
48% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 0
% eosinophils; 2

SUMMARY:  The marrow contains a very small number of plasma cells with normal morphology, in contrast to the large atypical plasma cells seen in the patient's diagnostic marrow (S
11-70516).  The plasma cells appear to be polytypic based on in situ hybridization.  Flow cytometry shows an extremely small plasma cell with a suggestion of an elevated kappa:lambda ratio.  However, definitive assessment of clonality on the very small pl
asma cell population is difficult.  There is no definite evidence of residual plasma cell myeloma.

1224,S12-33966,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW [SIDE NOT SPECIFIED],BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Mildly hypercellular marrow with erythroid hyperplasia, mild to moderate dysplasia and increased myeloid blasts consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with excess blasts).
Note:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.
The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete but shifted to the left.
Erythroid maturation is complete but shifted to the left.  Megakaryocytes are decreased.  The megakaryocytes include
 occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei.  Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in small clust
ers and as scattered cells and comprise approximately 5-10% of the cellularity.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small
 perivascular clusters. They consist of mature forms and comprise about 5% of the cellularity.  
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that CD34 labels small blasts scattered singly and in small cluster
s (5 to 10% of all cells), some of which are abnormally localized distant from the trabecular bone.  CD117 stains myeloid blasts and erythroid blasts, for a total of
 15 to 20% of cells.
The aspirate smear is hemodilute and paucicellular.  
A 100-
cell count reveals: 38% neutrophils and precursors; 32% erythroid precursors; 18% lymphocytes; 
2% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 2
% promyelocytes; 7% blasts; and 0% plasma cells.
  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted and mildly to moderately dysplastic with occasional abnormal nuclear lobation, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and rare hypogranulation.  Erythroid maturation is mildly dysplastic with occasional nuclear irregularities, late mitoses, and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are
 dysplastic with occasional small forms with separated nuclear lobes.
CBC results from 5/29/2012 are as follows: WBC 1.1; HGB 9.7 HCT 27.3%; MCV 113 fl; PLT 25.  Auto differential: 31% polys; 61% lymphs; 4% monos; 3% eos; 1% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals rare possible bilobed neutrophils,
 reactive-appearing lymphocytes, and unremarkable monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  
SUMMARY:  Compared to the prior biopsy from 2/13/2012 (S12-9630), dysplastic features are more pronounced and the number of myeloid blasts has increa
sed.  Blasts comprise 5 to 10% of the cellularity on the core biopsy, 7% on the aspirate smear, and 3% by flow cytometry (see below).  The blasts are probably underrepresented on the specimen for flow cytometry due to hemodilution.  
The findings are cons
istent with a myelodysplastic syndrome, best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts.  Distinguishing between RAEB1 and RAEB2 is difficult on the basis of this specimen.

1230,S12-34036,Final Diagnosis,"A.  SPLEEN, SPLENECTOMY:  
- Markedly enlarged spleen (1.14 kg) with red pulp congestion and loose aggregates of histiocytes with focal necrosis.
- Hilar lymph nodes with focal acute inflammation and necrosis.

Note:  The spleen shows prominent expansion of the red pulp with congestion and scattered large, lo
ose aggregates of histiocytes suggesting poorly formed granulomas, with rare multinucleated giant cells and sometimes foci of hemorrhage, apoptotic debris, and very early suppurative necrosis.  White pulp is widely separated but is overall intact.  A few 
m
egakaryocytes are present in red pulp.  Lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis, focally associated with early suppurative necrosis.  Immunostains show many B-cells (CD20+) in white pulp, and scattered in small numbers in red pulp. There are many CD3+ T-cell
s
 scattered and clustered in red pulp.  There are many plasma cells staining in a polytypic pattern with in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains.  In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) shows no stain
ing.  No microorganisms are identified on special stains (AFB, GMS, Steiner).  In addition, cultures performed in Microbiology have been negative.  Flow cytometry shows no specific abnormality (see below).  The changes are unusual; their etiology is uncertain. They rai
se the question of an infectious process, although they are not diagnostic of any particular type of infection. Other considerations include an unusual manifestation of autoimmune disease or systemic vasculitis.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  ANCA
 could be performed if not previously obtained.  This difficult case also has been reviewed by Dr. Richard Kradin.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Two of 20 metaphases contained the clonal aberration described above.  This translocation is not known to be characteristic of any particular type of tumor.  However, FISH analysis demonstrated IGH rearrangement in 6% of the cells.
Molecular genetic studies (see corresponding report from Genzyme) revealed no NPM1 exon 12 mutation, no FLT3 ITD mutation, and no FLT3D835 mutation.

 (SIDE NOT SPECIFIED), BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIHERAL SMEAR:  
Acute myeloid leukemia. (See note).
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare marrow particles. The marr
ow cellularity is overall approximately 15% (range 5 to 20%).
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal. Myeloid maturation is
 complete but shifted to the left. Erythroid maturation is complete. 
The megakaryocytes include occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei. Primitive cells consistent with blasts
 are increased and occur as scattered cells and in clusters and comprise approximately 30% of the cellularity. 
The blasts are small to medium-sized with round to slightly irregular nuclei, prominent nucle
oli and scant cytoplasm.
Plasma cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms and comprise about 5% of the cellularity. 
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.
 Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal
 that approximately 30% of the cells are CD34+ and approximately 40% are CD117+. CD138 highlights scattered plasma cells expressing polytypic light chain with 
in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but there are frequent ""naked"" nuclei.

d to slightly irregular, 
folded nuclei, dispersed chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm,

results from 5/29/12 are as follows: WBC 2.0; HGB 115; HCT 33.7%; MCV 97 fl; PLT 231.   Auto differential: 25% polys; 68% lymphs; 1% monos; 6% eos. 
Review of the peripheral smear reveals
 reactive-appearing lymphocytes and unremarkable granulocytes. There are rare medium-sized cells with ovoid nuclei, dispersed chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm, suspicious for blasts.
SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia, arising in a hypocellular marrow. Although striking dysplasia is not seen in maturing hematopoietic elements, the
 history of neutropenia since 11/20/11 raises the possibility of an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome
. The significance of the transient increased blast count in a preceding bone marrow sample from 11/16/2011(reviewed at MGH (see S11-77612) that subsequently spontaneously resolved (see S11-8005
8) and was likely related to G-CSF administration, is uncertain.

1269,S12-34117,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW, BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR (LEFT ILIAC CREST):  
Hypocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and increased myeloid blasts, consistent with
 acute myeloid leukemia, recurrent (see note).  
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 20% (range: 10% to 30%).  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.  Myeloid maturation is complete but 
shifted to the left.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are 
decreased, with overall normal morphology, with few small hypolobated forms.  Primitive cells suspicious for blasts appear
 increased and occur as scattered cells and in small clusters.  The blasts are small, with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells; they consist of mature forms and comprise <5% of the cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 60.5% neutrophils and precursors, 9.5% erythroid precursors, 8.5% lymphocytes, 0.5% monocytes, 3.5% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 14.5% blasts, and 2% plasma c
ells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted.  Erythroid maturation is normal overall, with rare nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony and nuclear irregularities.  
Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  The blasts are small, with round nuclei, dispersed chro
matin, prominent nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm with sparse azurophilic granules.  
CBC results from 5-29-12 are as follows: WBC 1.2; HGB 7.4; HCT 21.5%; MCV 112 fl; PLT 75.  Manual differential:  10% polys; 79% lymphs; 3% atypical lymphs; 0% m
onos; 8% eos;  and 0% basos.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals pancytopenia with toxic granulation and occasional vacuolization of granulocytes and reactive-appearing lymphocytes.  
SUMMARY:  Myeloid blasts are increased (14.5% on the aspirate, and 21% by flow cytometry) in a background of maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.  The findings are consistent with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.  Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12 T03599).

Markedly hypercellular marrow with extensive involvement by low-grade B-cell lymphoma.  (See note.)

Note:  
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  
The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90% (range 50 to 100%).  
Normal hematopoietic elements are decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morphology.  The megakaryocytes include
  occasional  small forms with hyperchromatic nuclei.  There is a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphoid cells with irregular
, angular nuclei throughout the marrow.  
The lymphoid cells account for 80% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 70
% of the intertrabecular marrow space.
  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells admixed with the lymphoid infiltrate.  They consist of mostly mature forms and comprise about <5% of the cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 1+-2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute.  A 200-

% erythroid precursors; 91% lymphocytes; 0
% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 
0% basophils; 0
% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 0% plasma cells.
  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is
 not evaluable.  No intact megakaryocytes are identified.  The lymphocytes are small to medium-sized with round to slightly irregular nuclei, condensed chromatin and scant basophilic cytoplasm.  

CBC results from 5/30/2012 are as follows: WBC 10.1; HGB 8.2; HCT 26%; MCV 92 fl; PLT 90.  Manual differential: 20% polys; 78% lymphs; 1% monos; 0% eos; 1% basos.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals
 lymphocytosis with mostly small, occasionally medium-sized lymphocytes with round to irregular nuclei, condensed chromatin, small nucleoli, and scant basophilic cytoplasm.  Neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils
 are also present and appear normal.
SUMMARY:  There is extensive involvement by a low-grade B-cell lymphoma with morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics consistent with the patient'
s previously diagnosed follicular lymphoma (MS-10-R78377).  The peripheral blood also appears to be involved by the same process.

1314,S12-36555,Addendum,"Tissue from this case
 was submitted to the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BL12-E18305). Results are as follows:

DNA was isolated from frozen tissue, stomach, S12-36555, and analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction technique using pri
mers conjugated with fluorescent dyes that hybridize to conserved framework (regions 1, 2 and 3) and joining regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (InVivoScribe Technologies, BIOMED, San Diego, CA).  The PCR products were analyzed by capillary ge
l electrophoresis.

RESULT:
IgH:  Clonal pattern.
A clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement is identified with framework I (328.1 bp), framework II (263.2 bp) and framework III (131.0 bp) primers.

INTERPRETATION:
These findings indicate the presence of a clonal B cell population.  Correlation with histologic, immunophenotypic, as well as other laboratory and clinical findings is suggested.

Conclusion:  In conjunction the histologic and immunophenotypic features described above, these results s
upport a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, consistent with extranodal (gastric)
 marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.  Of note, the patient has also had a recent diagnosis of pulmonary marginal zone lymphoma (S12-38419)."

1316,S12-36555,Final Diagnosis,"A.  STOMACH ULCER, BIOPSY:  
Gastric body mucosa with a prominent lymphoid aggregate.

Note:  The section reveals fragments of gastric tissue with a prominent lymphoid aggregate.  The lymphoid aggregate contains a germinal center which is surrounded by small to medium-sized lymphocytes with round nuclear borders and 
scant cytoplasm with crush artifact in some areas.

Immunohistochemistry
 reveals the lymphoid infiltrate to be comprised predominantly of CD20+ B cells with scattered CD3+ T cells.  The germinal center stains for Bcl-6 but is negative for Bcl-2 consistent with a
 reactive lymphoid follicle.  An intact follicular dendritic meshwork is present on CD21 stain.  

B.  STOMACH BIOPSY ULCER IN NACL:  
Atypical lymphoid infiltrate.

Note:  The section reveals fragments of gastric tissue with a diffuse-appearing mucosal and submucosal lymphoid infiltrate.  Focally gastric mucosa appears intact.  The lymphoid infiltrate is focally crushed, but where well preserved is compo
sed of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with condensed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.  

Immunohistochemistry reveals the lymphoid infiltrate to be compo
sed of predominantly CD20+, PAX5+, CD19+ B cells with admixed CD3+ T cells.  Bcl-6 stains one cluster of cells.  Most cells are Bcl2+.  Lymphoid cells are negative for cyclin D1.  
A Ki-67 immunostain reveals a proliferate index of < 5%.  CD21 highlights distorted follicular dendritic cell
 meshworks associated with the infiltrate.  With antibody to kappa and lambda immunoglobin light chain, there a
re a few polytypic plasma cells.  Among lymphoid cells there is a blush of staining with kappa that is not seen with lambda, but the possibility of non-specific staining cannot be excluded.  

Flow cytometry is non-diagnostic because of lack of viable lymphoid cells.  This may have been due to the sample containing crushed lymphoid tissue or non-lymphoid tissue.

The findings are atypical and raise the question of a low-grade B-cell lymphoma, in particular, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma); however, they are not sufficient for a definite diagnosis, and the possibility of a reactive infiltrate remains in the differential diagnosis.  

Frozen tissue will be sent for molecular studies to try to identify a clonal B-cell population.  Results will be reported separately.

 inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. Occasional larger cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli are present but they comprise <15 cells/hpf.
Immunohistochemistry reveals predominantly CD20+, Bcl-6+, Bcl-2+ B cells arranged in vague follicles with CD21 high
lighting follicular dendritic meshworks. Scattered CD3+ T cells are present. A K
i-67 immunostain reveals a variable proliferation index which is overall about 30%. Flow cytometry of the same specimen reveals 65% B cells (CD19+, CD20+, CD5-, CD10+, CD23+/-) with monotypic cytoplasmic lambda immunoglobin light chain expression.
Overall the findings are consistent with a low-grade follicular lymphoma. No metastatic carcinoma is seen in either biopsy.

SUMMARY:  The findings are not suggestive of acute leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasm or a myelodysplastic syndrome; the recent rapid decrease in counts and the young age of the patient are also against myelodysplastic syndrome.   The appearance of the marrow
 suggests peripheral loss or destruction of blood elements
 rather than failure of marrow production, with possible causes that might include infection, effect of drug or toxin, and/or immune-mediated destruction.  Another consideration is whether the marrow in this specimen is not optimally representative of the patient's marrow as a whole

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is partly crushed and consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum but is in areas adequate for evaluation. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased. 
Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with a paucity of mature forms. Erythroid maturation is
 complete. Megakaryocytes are decreased, some with overall normal morphology. The megakaryocytes include
 occasional dysplastic-appearing small forms with hypolobated nuclei. 
No lymphoid aggregates are seen.
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal
 that CD34 stains slightly <5% of cells; CD117 stains 10-15% of cells. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen on routinely stained sections.

- Markedly hypocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and left-shifted myelopoiesis.
- There is no morphologic evidence of residual/recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
- See note.
Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 5%. Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 decreased. Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with very few forms beyond the metamyelocyte stage. Erythroid maturation is complete. A few morphologically normal megakaryocytes are seen. No lymphoid aggregates are seen. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (ou
t of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  It appears more cellular than the core biopsy. The touch prep slide is inadequate for evaluation. A 200 cel
l count reveals: 33% neutrophils and precursors; 50% erythroid precursors; 10% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 3% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 1% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is left-shifted with near total maturation arrest a
t the myelocyte-metamyelocyte stage. There are few mature forms and retention of primary granules. Erythroid
 maturation is complete with focal nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear budding and irregularities, and binucleation. Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.

CBC results from 6/15/12 are as follows: WBC 1.9; HGB 9.6; HCT 28.8%; MCV 95 fl; and PLT 126.  Manual differential: 0% polys; 20% bands; 4% metamyelocytes; 4% myelocytes; 64% lymphs; 8% monos; 0% eos; and 0% basos. Review of the periphe
ral smear reveals a range of maturing myeloids.
SUMMARY:  The findings are those of a hypocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis with left-shifted myeloid elements. The aspirate and the clot section appear more cellular than the core biopsy.  There is no evidence of acute leukemia.

Note: 
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 20% (range 5 to 50%). Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. Myeloid maturation is complete. 
Erythroid maturation is
 complete. Megakaryocytes are decreased. Plasma cells occur in aggregates. They consist of en
larged atypical forms with conspicuous nucleoli and comprise about 80% of the cellularity.  Reticulin stain shows 1+
 to 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal
 that atypical cells are CD138 bright positive. In-situ hybridization for
 kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains shows no convincing staining of the
 atypical plasma cells, although there are few scattered kappa positive plasma cells among residual hematopoietic 
elements, while lambda positive plasma cells are essentially absent. Ki67 stains approximately 80 to 90% of atypical plasma cells.  
CD3 stains a few scattered small T cells. There is no increase in CD34+ blasts.  Myeloperoxidase stains maturing myeloid elements.

The aspirate smear is hemodilute with many
 bare nuclei. T
he touch prep slide is suboptimal for evaluation. A 200 cell count reveals: 54% neutrophils and precursors; 2% erythroid precursors; 8% lymphocytes; 3% mono
cytes; 3% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 29% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is left-shifted. Erythroid maturation is not optimally evaluable. Megakaryocytes are present. Plasma cells are large-sized with round eccentric nuclei, clumped chromatin, variably prominent nucleoli and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. 

CBC results from 6/25/12 are
 as follows: WBC 15.5; HGB 13.6; HCT 39.6%; MCV 97 fl; PLT 70. Manual differential: 58% polys; 12% bands; 1
% myelocytes; 3% promyelocytes;13% lymphs; 3% 
atypical lymphs; 6% monos; 4% eos; 0% basos. 
Review of the peripheral smear reveals mature and occasion
al left-shifted myeloid forms as well as a few nucleated red blood cells and a few cells suspicious for circulating plasma cells. 

Summary: The findings are consistent with recurrent plasma cell myeloma. T
he atypical plasma cells appear poorly differentiated, with a high proliferation index, consistent with histologic progression of the patient\loch\af1\dbch\af11'

There is no definitive morphologic evidence of persistent acute myeloid leukemia.
Note:  The bone marrow biop
sy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is slightly increased.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left but complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased and some 
occur in small clusters.  The megakaryocytes include frequent atypical large forms with hypolobated, as well as, hyperlobated/complex and hyperchromatic nuclei.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4)

 are performed on the marrow core biopsy.  These show CD20+ B cells and CD3+ T cells in clusters and also scattered singly in the marrow.  B and T cells are present in similar numbers, a result that differs from that of flow cytometry
 (in which B cells were scarce), possibly due to sampling artifact.  CD138 highlights frequent plasma cells in an interstitial distribution.  With 
in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains there is a substantial excess of lambda-positive plasma cells compared to kappa-pos
itive plasma cells, consistent with a clonal lambda-positive population in a polytypic background.  Stains for immunoglobulin heavy chains are also performed.  Many plasma cells are IgM+, while only a few scattered plasma cells express IgG or IgA. 
These results are consistent with a monotypic IgM lambda+ plasma cell population.
These results, in a patient with an IgM M component, are consistent with a diagnosis of early marrow involvement by B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, most consistent with LYMPHOPLASMACYTIC LYMPHOMA.

on is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased, with overall normal morphology
.  There are multiple non-paratrabecular aggregates and an interstitial infiltrate
 of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclei.  The lymphoid cells account for 80% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 50% of the intertrabecular marrow space.  Within the lymphoid infiltrate there are scattered ill-defined proliferation centers.  
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is hemodilute and paucicellular.  A 100-cell count reveals: 18% neutrophils and precursors, 8% erythroid precursors, 72% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 1

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall < 5%.  
There is abundant interstitial eosinophilic material; the scant cellularity consists predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes

ments are markedly decreased.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear appears to consist entirely of peripheral blood elements and is inadequate

Acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic features. (See note.)
Note: The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. 
The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%. 
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. The
 marrow cellularity is predominantly composed of medium sized cells with moderate cytoplasm, markedly irregular and folded nuclei, and occasional nucleoli, consistent with monocytic differentiation. 

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. A 200 cell count reveals: 4%
 neutrophils and precursors; 11% erythroid precursors; 2% lymphocytes; 3% monocytes; 1% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 1
% promyelocytes; 72% promonocytes; 5% blasts; and 1% plasma cells. Myeloid maturation is 
markedly left-shifted. Erythroid maturation is
 normal except for rare nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. 
Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal. The blasts are medium sized with scant basophilic cytoplasm, round to ovoid nuclei, and fine chromatin. The promonocytes are medium to larg
e sized with moderate cytoplasm containing azurophilic granules, irregular nuclei, occasional nucleoli, and finely granular chromatin.

% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 30% o
f the intertrabecular marrow space.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells within the lymphoid infiltrate.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case on both biopsy and separately submitted clot.  Scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages are present.  Occasional mast cells are scattered singly within the lymphoid infiltrate.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200 cell count reveals: 34% neutrophils and prec
ursors; 20% erythroid precursors; 41% lymphocytes; 0% monocytes; 3% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 2% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  
Erythroid maturation is normal except for slight nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony and nuclear budding.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  

CBC results from 7/12/12 are as follows: WBC 6.2; HGB 11.0; HCT 33.0%; MCV 93 fl; PLT 129.  Manual differential: 39
% polys; 55% lymphs; 
4% monos; 2
% eos; 0% basos.
  Review of the peripheral smear reveals small to medium-sized lymphocytes with scant to moderate basophilic cytoplasm, and round to 
irregular nuclei.  Some appear to show plasmacytic features.  Some show small delicate villous cytoplasmic processes which are sometimes polar.  

SUMMARY:  The marrow is involved by a low grade B-cell lymphoma.  Additional stains are pending to subclassify the lymphoma; results will be reported in an addendum.

Diffuse high-grade B-cell lymphoma (see note).  
NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic and partly crushed, but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare crushed marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%.  Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased
.  The marrow is predominantly occupied by medium-sized lymphocytes with scant to moderate cytoplasm, oval and ir
regular nuclei, coarse chromatin, and multiple small nucleoli, with an admixture of occasional large cells with vesicular nuclei.  Mitoses are frequent.  There are numerous interspersed cells undergoing apoptosis.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that the atypical lymphoid cells are CD20+ (diffuse, strong) with scattered admixed small T cells (CD3+).  Most c
ells are BCL-6+.  A subset of atypical cells co-expresses BCL-2 and MUM-1/IRF-4.  Ki-67 stains virtually 100% of cells.  With 
in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains, a few plasma cells expressing polytypic light chain are se
en, but atypical cells are negative.  With in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER), there is no staining.  
The aspirate smear is focally adequate for evaluation but is overall hemodilute and paucicellular.  A 200-cell count reveal
s: 38% neutrophils and precursors, 7% erythroid precursors, 5% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, 0% plasma cells, and 50% larger lymphocytes.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is left-shifted and erythroid elements are markedly decreased
.  Megakaryocytes are absent.  The larger lymphocytes have scant to moderate basophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, and prominent nucleoli.  A few have fine cytoplasmic vacuoles.  
CBC results from 7-16-12 are as follows: WBC 4.8; HGB 7.1; HCT 21.4%; MCV 82 fl; PLT 159.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals normal leukocytes, as well as rare atypical lymphoid cells similar to those in the marrow.  

SUMMARY:  The marrow is extensively involved by a diffuse high-grade B-cell lymphoma.  The appearance overall is suspicious for Bu
rkitt's lymphoma, although some
 features are unusual for Burkitt's lymphoma, including occasional large neoplastic cells and partial expression of BCL-2.  Correlation with res
ults of cytogenetics (CG-12-N04685) is required for precise subclassification.

.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.
Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with a paucity of mature forms, although many myeloid forms maturing to myelocyte/metamyelocyte stage are seen.  Erythroid maturation is shifted to th
e left.  Megakaryocytes are increased and occur in frequent small clusters.  There are rare non-paratrabecular aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round nuclei.  Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and

INTERPRETATION:
There is a borderline increase in myeloid blasts as well as a tiny population of cells with the immunophenotype of lymphoid blasts; the latter
 may represent a very small amount of residual disease.  The 5% myeloid blasts could possibly represent regenerating non-neoplastic bl
asts.  Expression of MPO on the tiny population of lymphoid blasts (as seen in the original leukemia), is difficult to assess because of the larger number of myeloid blasts present.

 are increased.  The blasts are medium-sized with round to irre
gular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.  There are scattered lymphoid cells with round nuclei.  Mature plasma cells occur as scattered cells, 
sometimes in a perivascular distribution.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  The touch prep slide is adequate for evaluation.  A 200 cell count reveals: 46% neutrophils and precursors; 17% erythroid precursors; 
15% lymphocytes; 1% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 3% promyelocytes; 14% blasts; and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted and moderately dysplastic with abnormal nuclear lobation and hypogranulation.  
Erythroid maturation is left-shifted and moderately dysplastic with nuclear budding and irregularities, late mitoses, and binucleation.  Rare megakaryocytes are present and are dysplastic with small forms with complex nuclei and separated nuclear lobes.  The blasts are medium-sized wi
th moderate basophilic cytoplasm, ovoid to irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and occasional cytoplasmic granules.

Y AND ASPIRATE:
Plasma cell myeloma (see note).

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic and partly crushed but is 
adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately
 70-80%.
Normal hematopoietic elements are decreased. 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased. Myeloid maturation is
 complete. Erythroid maturation is complete. Megakaryocytes are adequate with overall normal morphology and occur in occasional small clusters. Plasma cells occur in large clusters and as a diffuse infiltrate. They consist of mostly large atypic
al forms with large conspicuous nucleoli. The atypical plasma cells have the morphology of plasmablasts. 
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining with increased 3+ staining in the plasma cell aggregates. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. 
A 200 cell count reveals: 30
% neutrophils and precursors; 21% erythroid precursors; 
9% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 3% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 1% promyelocytes; 1% blasts; and 32% plasma cells.
 Myeloid maturation is left-sifted but complete. Erythroid maturation is complete with occasional late mi
toses. An iron stain demonstrates the presence of storage iron and no ring sideroblasts. The plasma cells are medium-sized to large with basophilic c
ytoplasm with many having distinct nucleoli.

Variably cellular, overall hypocellular marrow with decreased hematopoietic  elements.  
There is no evidence of accelerated phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia.
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic and partly crushed with scant evaluable marrow but is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 25% (range <5 to 60%).  In areas, t
here is abundant interstitial eosinophilic material; the scant cellularity consists predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.
  In other small areas, there is active hematopoiesis.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.  Myeloid maturation is
 complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Scattered interstitial lymphocytes are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 2-3+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is
 hemodilute and paucicellular and may not be representable.  A 100-cell count reveals: 24%
 neutrophils and precursors; 12% erythroid precursors; 45% lymphocytes; 5% monocytes; 14

SUMMARY:  The bone marrow sample is limited, but the areas of intact hypocellular marrow resemble a chemotherapy ablated marrow and t
he scant areas of cellular marrow consist predominantly of maturing myeloids and erythroids.  It is possible that the more cellular areas represent regeneration; correlation with CBCs over time could be informative.

There is no evidence of marrow involvement by B-cell lymphoma. 

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small, hemorrhagic and partly crushed but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 70%. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete. 
Megakaryocytes are slightly decreased wi

SUMMARY: The findings taken together are somewhat unusual, but there is no evidence of B-cell lymphoma involving the marrow. See also results of flow cytometry below, which show relatively abundant CD8+ T cells but
 no evidence for a monoclonal B cell population. The significance of the CD8+ lymphocytosis is uncertain.  It could represent a reactive process, possibly related to infection or prior therapy

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  
The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 95%.  Normal maturing myeloid 
elements are markedly decreased.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is
 increased.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid elements are mildly to moderately decreased.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morphology.  
Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in sheets and co
mprise approximately 90% of the cellularity.  The blasts are medium-sized to large with ovoid to indented or lobated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant cytoplasm with frequent granulation.   

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  
A 200-cell count reveals: 10% neutrophils and precursors; 8% erythroid precursors; 16% lymphocytes; 1% monocytes; 9% promyelocytes; 
56% blasts.
  Myeloid maturation is abnormal with retention of primary granules.  Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakary
ocytes are rare but appear normal.  The blasts are medium to large-sized with indented to folded nuclei, fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of cytoplasm with numerous prominent coarse, occasionally fine,

partly crushed and consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum with slightly hypocellular subcortical marrow, but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 20% (range 5 to 40%).
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal to slightly decreased.  
Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are
 adequate with overall normal morphology. 
No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  The estimated cellularity based on the core may be low due to the hypocellular nature that subcortical marrow may have.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.

NOTE:  The aspirate sm
ear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 7% neutrophils and precursors, 1% erythroid precursors, 9% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 82% blasts.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroids are rare but morphologically normal.  Megakaryocytes are rare and appear normal.  The blasts are small to medium-sized, with round to slightly lobated nuclei, fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm.  Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.

1.  Hypercellular marrow with involvement by B-cell lymphoma (see note).
2.  Trilineage hematopoiesis.

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy spec
imen is small, partly crushed and consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum with a strip of subcortical marrow.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60-70%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is not evaluable.  
Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate, and include 
some with normal morphology and some that are small and hypolobated.  There are scattered small paratrab
ecular and non-paratrabecular aggregates and a scattered interstitial infiltrate of medium-sized to large lymphoid cells with round to irregular vesicular nuclei.  The larger cel
ls are preferentially arrayed immediately adjacent to bony trabeculae. One aggregate contains a higher proportion of small cells.  The lymphoid cells account for 
25% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 15
% of the intertrabecular marrow space.  Plasma cells occur as rare scattered mature cells.  

The touch prep slide is paucicellul
ar.  The touch prep does show maturing hematopoietic elements and occasional lymphoid cells, although it is overall somewhat suboptimal for a differential count.  

CBC results from 7/27/2012 are as follows: WBC 7.9; HGB 10.7; HCT 32.9%; MCV 87 fl; PLT 159.  Auto differential: 75% polys; 17% lymphs; 6% monos; 1% eos; 1% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear from 7/27/2012 
reveals a predominance of neutrophils
.  The lymphocytes are small mature forms with scant to moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm and dense chromatin.  Also seen are a few left-shifted myeloid forms.  Some platelets are large.  

SUMMARY:  The lymphoid infiltrate is consistent with marrow involvement by lymphoma, which was confirmed to be of B-lineage in a recent prior specimen (S12-48
405).  Subclassification is difficult on this specimen, but the proportion of medium-sized and large cells excludes a low-grade lymphoma.  Additional stains are pending to evaluate the lymphoma further; results will be reported in an addendum.

Acute myeloid leukemia. 
NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. 
The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80%. 
Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. Only rare maturing myeloid elements are seen.  Erythroids are rare but maturation is
 complete. Megakaryocytes are rare with overall normal morphology. Primitive cells consistent with blasts
 are increased and occur in sheets and comprise approximately 95% of the cellularity. The
 blasts are medium-sized to large with ovoid to irregular nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and scant to moderate eosinophi
lic cytoplasm. Only very rare mature myeloids are seen. Reticulin stain shows 0 to 
1+ (out of 4) fiber staining. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. 
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that the bl
asts stain for CD5. Lysozyme, and MPO stain scattered myeloids at a range of stages of differentiation. CD68 stains
 scattered cells, mostly histiocytes. Few scattered cells are TdT+. CD3 highlights scattered background T cells and CD79a and Pax5 stain occasional B cells. An immunostain for CD1a
 is negative. 
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. The touch prep slide is
 adequate for evaluation. A 200
 cell count reveals: 2% neutrophils and precursors; 4
% erythroid precursors; 2% lymphocytes; 92% blasts. Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. The blasts range in size from medium-sized to large cells, and
 have fine chromatin with distinct nucleoli and scant basophilic cytoplasm. Rare cytoplasmic granulation is seen. 
CBC results from 8/
1/2012 are as follows: WBC 3.5; HGB 7.8; HCT 22.9%; MCV 87 fl; PLT 78. Manual differential: 9% polys; 1
% bands; 56% lymphs; 24% other WBCs. Review of the peripheral smear reveals numerous medium-sized atypical cells with large nuclei, reticulated chromatin
, prominent nucleoli, and scant to moderately abundant lightly basophilic cytoplasm which is occasionally vacuolated. These cells are consistent with blasts.
SUMMARY:  The morphologic and flow cytometric analysis (see below) show the presence of a dominan
t population of myeloid blasts with scant normal marrow elements, consistent with acute myeloid leukemia. Dr. Robert Hasserjian 
has reviewed representative slides from this case, and agrees with the diagnosis above.

0%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are markedly 
decreased.  The megakaryocytes include rare dark, senescent forms and rare normal forms. There are rare small, non-paratrabecular clusters of small lymphocytes with slightly irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm.

penias, elevated MCV and Trisomy 21 on a recent outside marrow sample (our number S12-48005) are consistent with myelodysplasia.  Subclassification is difficult because of the unusual finding of minimal to absent evidence of dysplasia among myeloid and er

Persistent T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (see note).
NOTE:  The aspirate smear app
ears to consist almost entirely of peripheral blood elements and is suboptimal
 for evaluation.  A 50-cell count reveals: 14% neutrophils and precursors; 2% erythroid precursors; 50% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 32% blasts.  Myeloid and erythroid maturation is not optimally evaluable.  
Megakaryocytes are not seen.  The lymphocytes are predominantly small with dense chromatin and scant cytoplasm.  The blasts are small to medium-sized with fine to dark chromatin, some with prominent nucleoli, round to irregular 
nuclei, and scant cytoplasm.  The aspirate count may not be representative.  

CBC results from 8/2/2012 are as follows: WBC 3.2; HGB 12.2; HCT 36.2%; MCV 89 fl; PLT 208.  Manual differential: 7% polys; 1% bands; 9% blasts; 83% lymphs.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals
 leukopenia with a predominance of lymphoid cells, including small lymphocytes and scattered enlarged forms consistent with blasts.

SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with persistent T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Acute myeloid leukemia with t(9;11)(p22;q23); MLLT3-MLL (see note).  
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 95%.  Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased
.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left, with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased
, with overall normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  The majority of the cellularity (>80%) consists of cells with round, oval or 
convoluted nuclear contours and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, consistent with blasts and immature monocytes.  
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  The touch prep sli
de is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 10% neutrophils and precursors, 3% erythroid precursors, 5% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 12% promonocytes; 60% blasts, and 2% plasma cells.  Myeloid mat
uration is left-shifted and mildly dysplastic, with a few neutrophils with abnormal nuclear lobation and hypogranulation (< 50% of maturing myeloids).  Erythroid maturation shows occasional
 nuclear budding and late mitoses (<50% of erythroids).  Megakaryoc
ytes are present and appear normal.  The blasts are large atypical cells with fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm.  The monocytic population is composed of atypical immature forms with irregularly lobated nuclei and moderate amounts of
 basophilic cytoplasm.  

CBC results from 8-3-12 are as follows: WBC 23.1; HGB 7.5; HCT 22.8%; MCV 115 fl; PLT 72.  Manual differential: 12% polys;  1% myelocytes; 14% blasts; 46% lymphs;  27% monos; 0% eos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals a blast 
population composed of cells with scant basophilic cytoplasm, round nuclei with smooth chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  The monocytes show a range of maturation with atypical forms.  
SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia, with t(9;11) identified by 
cytogenetics (CG-12-G05086).  There are some abnormalities in maturing myeloid and 
erythroid elements, but they are not sufficient to be certain that myelodysplasia-related changes are present.

patients on TKIs are transient, without progression to MDS/AML. The presence of monosomy 7 with progression to MDS/AML has been described, however (1).

Moderately hypocellular, erythroid predominant marrow.
There is no evidence of accelerated phase or blast transformation of CML.  (See note.)
NOTE:  
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 20%. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is
 complete, but myeloid elements are moderately decreased.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are slightly decreased.  
The megakaryocytes include occasional small forms with hypolobated nuclei, although others are morphologically normal.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is hemodilute.  A 200-cell count reveals: 12
% neutrophils and precursors; 4% e
rythroid precursors; 79% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 2% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 0
% plasma cells.  The scant myeloid population matures completely.  
Erythroid maturation is complete but is difficult to evaluate more precisely because of the small number of erythroid elements present.  Megakaryocytes are present.  
The predominance of lymphocytes may be due to hemodilution, as the proportion of lymphocytes in the aspirate is similar to that in the peripheral blood.
CBC resu
lts from 8/7/2012 are as follows: WBC 3.3; HGB 13.3; HCT 41.9%; MCV 117 fl; PLT 62.  Manual differential: 17% polys; 69% lymphs; 12% monos; 2% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals thrombocytopenia with occasional large platelets
, and matu
re leukocytes.  Rare enlarged cells most consistent with reactive lymphoid cells are seen.

SUMMARY:  The specimen is a hypocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis
, but with decreased myeloid elements.  The aspirate shows increased lymphocytes, attributed to hemodilution.  There is no evidence of
 accelerated phase or blast transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia.  The morphologic features are also not suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, but correlation with molecular studies and cytogenetics (CG12-G05167) is required to exclude residual chronic myelogenous leukemia."

Making a definite diagnosis is difficult because of the hypo
cellular nature of the specimen, the subtle involvement by an increase in blasts on routinely stained sections, and the small numbers of blasts identified on the aspirate smear and by flow cytometry. 
If clinically indicated, rebiopsy is suggested to determine whether the changes persist, and also to obtain a more representative aspirate sample for blast count on smears and by flow cytometry.  Correlation with cytogenetics (pending)

 elements are decreased.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morphology.  There are rare non-paratrabecular aggregates of small
 lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclei in the clot.  Plasma
 cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

1902,S12-51089,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW (RIGHT ILIAC CREST), BIOPSY, ASPIRATE, AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, rare small lymphoid 
aggregate and slight plasmacytosis 
(see note).  

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains scant marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%.  The myeloid to eryt
hroid ratio is normal.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete but shifted to the left.  Megakaryocytes are adequate, with overall normal morphology.  There are rare non-paratrabecular aggregates of small lymphoid cells with roun
d to irregular nuclei.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells and in small clusters; they consist of mature forms.  There is focal remodeling of bone.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 41% neutrophils and precurso
rs, 37% erythroid precursors, 13% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 5% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is complete but left-shifted, with occasional nuclear budding and irregularities, and late mitoses.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.

CBC results from 8-9-12 are as follows: WBC ;10.9 HGB 7.6; HCT 24.3%; MCV 95 fl; PLT 147.  
Manual differential: 88% polys; 2% bands; 
7% lymphs;  3% monos;
 0% eos;  0% basos.  Revi
ew of the peripheral smear reveals normal leukocytes.

SUMMARY:  The specimen is a hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.  There is no morphologic evidence of involvement by lymphoma.  There is a slight plasmacytosis; stains will be performed to assess the clonality of the plasma cells and results will be reported in an addendum.  The erythroid series shows maturational abnormalities; these may be regenerative in nature, but if the patient's anemia fails to resolve, the possibility of other causes, including myelodysplasia, may be considered.

 composed of many small lymphocytes and many scattered large atypical cells, including bi- and multinucleated Reed-Sternberg-like cells.  Rare eosinophils and occasional
 histiocytes are present.  
Flow cytometric analysis discloses a CD20+, CD5+ light chain-restricted B-cell population consistent with persistent or recurrent small lymphocytic lymphoma / chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Immunostains show that large 
atypical cells are CD15-, CD30+, PAX5 dim, CD20-negative.  Small lymphocytes
 are a mixture of CD3+, CD5+ T cells and CD20+ B cells.  CD5 expression on B cells cannot be evaluated because of the many admixed T cells.  Atypical cells are negative for keratin (AE1,3; CAM5.2 cocktail).  There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  
The findings are consistent with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, which rarely arises in patients with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia

NOTE:  The specimen consists of fragments of bone with remodelling, with the marrow space filled by many plasma cel
ls and abundant amyloid associated with a florid histiocytic giant cell reaction.  In addition, there are areas with a 
prominent fibrohistiocytic proliferation, occasionally with a storiform pattern.  A Congo Red stain highlights the amyloid, which shows green birefringence on polarization.  Immunostains show scattered and clustered CD138+ plasma cells.  Numerous CD68
+, CD163+ histiocytes are present throughout the tissue.  With in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains, plasma cells appear to express monotypic lambda light chain.  
Overall,
 the findings are consistent with a plasmacytoma associated with abundant amyloid.  The lesion is unusual in that the proportion composed of plasma cells is relatively small, while the amyloid and the histiocytic proliferation occupy the majority of the lesion.  
In addition, the fibrohistiocytic proliferation in the context of a plasmacytoma is quite unusual, but it likely represents a reactive process related to the plasmacytoma with amyloid.

2025,S12-60032,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LEFT PAROTID GLAND MASS, RESECTION:  
 Parotid gland with multiple lymph nodes with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with unusual features.

Note: The speci
men consists of parotid gland with multiple small to slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Overall architecture is preserved in the nodes. The lymph nodes show follicular and paracortical hyperplasia and patent sinuses with sinus histiocytosis.  Many of the foll
i
cles have small, involuted-appearing germinal centers. Focally (slide A5) there is an ill-defined nodule of small lymphocytes with very few interspersed large lymphoid cells with large oval to slightly indented nuclei, vesicular chromatin and small nucleo
li. This nodule may represent progressive transformation of a germinal center, but the composition is quite monotonous.

Immunostains show many CD20+ B cells mainly in follicles. Most cells in the large nodule are CD20+. CD3 highlights numerous T cells, mai
nly in an interfollicular distribution. PD1 highlights scattered cells in germinal centers and in the large nodule, but does not disclose T cell rosettes. CD21 stains follicular dendritic meshworks associated with the follicles and with the large nodule. 
CD30 stains few scattered cells of a range of sizes. CD15 stains a few granulocytes.

Flow cytometry shows no abnormal B or T-cell population, except that the CD4:CD8 ratio is unusually high (18:1).

In summary, much of the lymphoid tissue is reactive, but 
with focal architectural distortion and with a markedly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio. The findings are not diagnostic of lymphoma or of any other neoplasm, and could represent a reactive process. However, if this patient has any other enlarged lymph nodes, biop
sy of one of them could be considered to exclude a significant abnormality, if clinically indicated."

ing closely matches staining of EBV+ B cells in areas, so that nearly all EBV+ B cells appear CD30+.  In addition in some areas there is an excess of CD30+ cells compared to EBV+ B cells, and CD30 appears to stain a subset of PD1+ neoplastic T cells.

The diagnosis given above is unchanged."

2038,S12-60354,Final Diagnosis,"A & C.  LYMPH NODE, LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY:
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.
NOTE:  The lymph node architecture is effaced by marked expansion of the
 paracortex by small lymphocytes, small to medium-sized lymphocytes with pale cytoplasm and irregular nuclei, and many admixed neutrophils, histiocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells
.  Scattered mitotic figures are seen.  A proliferation of high endothelial venules is noted.  Also seen are scattered and focally loosely aggregated immunoblasts.  Aggregates and bands of spindle cells consistent with follicular dendritic cell are present.  Occasional sinuses are patent.  In areas the infiltrate extends into perinodal fat while the adjacent subcapsular sinus is patent.  

Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
  Immunohistochemical stains reveal that the majority of the lymphoid cells are CD3+ T cells, with more CD4+ T cells than CD8+ cells
.  A subset of T cells expresses CD3 dimly.  A subset of the T cells is CD10+ and PD1+.  Numerous CD20+ B cells are also present and predominantly limited to irregularly shaped follicles. There are multiple markedly expanded, irregular follic
ular dendritic cell meshworks, which are highlighted by CD21.  In-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda highlights polytypic plasma cells.  In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) is positive among CD20+ B-lineage immunoblasts.

O
verall the findings support a diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, with an abnormal population of CD3dim+, CD4+, PD1+, CD10+ T cells, accompanied by a population of EBV+ B immunoblasts.  There is apparent excess staining for kappa among the im
munoblasts, but on comparison with controls, the excess kappa staining is likely related to technical factors.  
B & D.  SKIN BIOPSY, RIGHT CHEST AND RIGHT ADDITIONAL CHEST, BIOPSY:
Highly atypical EBV+ B-lineage lymphoproliferative disorder.  
NOTE:  The
 biopsies show large nodules and sheets of lymphoid cells within superficial and deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.  The proliferation consists of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells, immunoblasts, histiocytes and plasma cells, with frequent mitoses an
d focal apoptotic debris.  A few eosinophils are seen focally.  The epidermis is spared.  The infiltrate involves the inked margin.  
Immunostains show a predominance of CD20+ B cells with many scattered admixed T cells (CD3+).  B cells are of a range of sizes while T cells are mostly small. There is some variation in intensity of staining for CD3. 
 Rare scattered cells are CD10+.  Many T cells are PD1+.  T cells are a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  Numerous B cells are EBV+ with in-situ hybridization f
or Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  With in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains there are small numbers of polytypic plasma cells, and staining for kappa and lambda among larger B cells is similar to that seen in the lymph node. There is no staining for CD21. 
The findings are those of an EBV+ B-lineage lymphoproliferative disorder, likely related to the patient's concurrent angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.  The composition is somewhat polymorphous and there is no 
unequivocal evidence of clonality, so that the findings are not diagnostic of an EBV+ d
iffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Studies for clonality on the patient's prior skin biopsy (S12-57096) 
are in progress.  
Of note, flow cytometry disclosed abnormal T-cell populations in both the lymph node and the skin (see below) so tha
t in the skin biopsy although T cells do not predominate, the skin biopsy likely is subtly involved by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.
This immunoperoxidase test was developed and its 
performance characteristics determined by the pathology department at the Massachusetts General Hospital. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S.

Changes consistent with lymphoepithelial sialadenitis with a small clonal B-cell population.
NOTE: The specimen consists of 
a biopsy of parotid gland with a dense, mostly interstitial infiltrate of small lymphocytes and scattered plasma cells. Glandular architecture is distorted by the lymphoid infiltrate but epithelial elements are overall intact. There are a few small lympho
e
pithelial lesions, focally surrounded by small numbers of small lymphoid cells with clear cytoplasm consistent with monocytoid B cells. Away from the areas with the lymphoid infiltrate there is a small duct with luminal neutrophils surrounded by loose fib
rosis with few admixed eosinophils and plasma cells, suggestive of a component of obstruction.       

Immunostains show that the lymphoid infiltrate is composed of CD20+ B cells and CD3+, CD5+, CD43+ T cells. B cells appear negative for CD5 and CD43. A few
 B cells and also T cells infiltrate the epithelial structures. Many scattered plasma cells appear polytypic with in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains. Epithelial elements are positive with antibody to cytokeratin (AE1, 3; Cam 5.2).
Flow cytometric analysis shows 11% monotypic kappa+ B cells (see below).
The histologic and immunohistochemical findings are not sufficient for a diagnosis of lymphoma, and are within the spectrum for a diagnosis of 
lymphoepithelial sialadenitis. A minority of B cells are
 a clonal population on flow cytometric evaluation, but given the other findings in this case, this is not considered sufficient for a primary diagnosis of lymphoma. Clonal B-cell populations may be found in association with Sj
ogren's syndrome; these clones may regress or progress. Clinical correlation and follow-up are suggested.

 There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).
The findings are those of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, with no evidence of lymphoma or any other neoplasm.  The significance of the increased IgG4+ plasma cells is uncertain.
  It raises the question about whether the patient might have IgG4-related disease, which is characterized by variable manifestations, including sclerosing lesions in extranodal sites and elevated serum IgG4, in additional to lymphadenopathy. 
Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with increased numbers of IgG4+ plasma cells can also likely occur as localized lymphadenopathy, unassociated with IgG4-related disease. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate 
consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.  (See note.)

Note: The specimen consists of mucosa with an underlying dense lymphocytic infiltrate with extensive crush artifact. Lymphocytes are mostly small with oval nuclei, smooth dark chromatin, and scant to moderate pale cytoplasm.  Many scattered plasma cel
ls are seen; some appear to contain Dutcher bodies.

Immunostains reveal that the majority of the lymphoid cells are CD20+ B-cells that are Bcl2+, CD10-, and CD5-. Numerous CD3+ CD5+ T-cells are admixed. CD21 highlights several large irregular 
follicular dendritic cell meshworks.  With in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains there are many scattered lambda+ plasma cells while kappa+ plasma cells are virtually absent. A PAS stain highlights a few Dutcher bodies.

The density of the lymphoid infiltrate, the B-cell predominance, and the evidence of plasmacytic differentiation in the form of monotypic lambda+ plasma cells and Dutcher bodies together support a diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue with plasmacytic differentiation. Of note, this patient has a prior history of marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) in several extranodal sites.

Mantle cell lymphoma (both specimens).  
NOTE:  The specimens consist of lymph nodes effaced by a vaguely nodular infiltrate
 of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with scant cytoplasm, irregular and cleaved nuclei, condensed chromatin, and scant cytoplasm.  Scattered and loosely clustered medium-sized to large cells with prominent nuclear irregularity and lobation
, with occasional distinct nucleoli
 are seen.  Numerous mitotic figures are seen.  Scattered admixed plasma cells and single epithelioid histiocytes are present.  Few hyalinized small vessels are seen.  
Immunostains reveal that the atypical cells are CD20+ B cells that coexpress CD5 (dim) and bcl-2.  Many scattered
 atypical cells are Cyclin-D1+.  About 10% of the cells are Myc+.  Admixed small CD3+ T cells are present.  CD10 and bcl-6 highlight few small residual follicles.  CD21 shows several large, irregular
ly expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is approximately 30%.  
The findings support a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.  The presence of frequent mitoses and some medium-sized to large pleomorphic cells suggest a diagnosis of the pleomorphic variant, which may behave in a more aggressive manner. The proliferation index appears lower than expected given the ease of finding mitotic figures, however. Flow cytometric analysis further supports the diagnosis (see below).

HHV8+, EBV+ large cell lymphoma. 

NOTE: The specimen consists of small cores of lymph node with multiple aggregates of large atypical cells with oval, slightly irregular and indented, horseshoe-shaped nuclei, prominent 
red nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm, often with coarse red granules with a tendency to concentrate in the Golgi region. The intervening lymphoid tissue contains mostly small lymphocytes and many plasma cells. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. 
Immunostains show that large atypical cells are positive for CD45, CD30, CD3, MUM1, HHV8+ and granzyme B. They are negative for cytokeratin (AE1. 3; Cam
 5.2 cocktail), CD5, ALK-1 and for kappa and lambda using in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains
. A few large cells are CD138+. There is a suggestion of expression of CD20 by a few large cells, but large cells are overall negative for CD20. Scattered large cells are perforin+. CD138 also highlights many plasma cells which are polytypic with in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains.  Ki67 (proliferation) stains approximately 60% of large cells.
The findings are those of an HHV8 (Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesv
irus/KSHV)+, EBV+ large cell lymphoma. It has features of the so-called solid variant of primary effusion lymphoma, or extracavitary variant of primary effusion lymphoma. One unusual feature is the strong expression of CD3. Nearly all HHV8+ lymphomas are 
of B-lineage, and they may aberrantly express T-cell markers, so that the staining for CD3 does not definitively establish T lineage. Additional immunostains and molecular studies using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are pending to establish lineage more definitively. Results will be reported in an addendum.

. Some of the immature myeloid elements are enlarged and somewhat atypical, occasionally with very prominent nucleoli.  Erythroid maturation is
 shifted to the left but is focally complete.  Megakaryocytes are markedly decreased.
Plasma cells occur as scattered cells and in small clusters. They consist of mature forms.  Many scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen.
Reticulin stain shows 2 to 3+ (out of 4) fiber staining. 
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
The aspirate smear is somewhat paucicellular but adequate for evaluation.  The touch prep slide is

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum, but is focally adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 85%.  Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased.   The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased.  Myeloid maturation is markedly shifted to the left, with a paucity of mature forms. Erythroid elements are rare. Megakaryocytes include some normal and some dysplastic forms.  Primitive cells consistent with

 and moderate cytoplasm.  Plasma cells occur as scattered
 cells; they consist of mature forms.  Reticulin stain shows 1 to 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 9% neutrophils and precursors, 7% erythroid precursors, 3% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1% promyelocytes, 74% blasts

nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear budding and irregularities, late mitoses and binucleation, affecting <50% of cells.  Megakaryocytes are decreased.  Blasts are medium to large, with oval to indented nuclei, with dispersed chromatin
, some with prominent nucleoli, and 
scant basophilic cytoplasm.  Occasional plasma cells are binucleated.  
CBC results from 9-27-12 are as follows: WBC 1.7; HGB 8.8; HCT 25.2%; MCV 100 fl; PLT 38.  Manual differential: 2% polys; 58% lymphs; 2% monos; 0% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals pancytopenia

Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis (see note).  

NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small, hemorrhagic, and partly crushed, but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains rare marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%.  Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Meg
akaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology.  
No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Few singly scattered mature plasma cells are seen.  
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  No increase in histiocytes is noted.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count reveals: 58
% neutrophils and precursors, 23% erythroid precursors, 9% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 6% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 0% promyelocytes, 0% blasts, and 3% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  An iron stain demonstrates the presence of increased storage iron and no ringed sideroblasts.

 BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Markedly hypocellular marrow with increased percentage of blasts consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (see note).

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and consists predominantly of cortical bone and periosteum with scant evaluable marrow. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 10%. Normal hematopoietic elements are markedly decreased. 
Megakaryocytes are
 absent. The cellularity consists of rare scattered maturing myeloid and erythroid elements and few scattered primitive cells suspicious for blasts. 
Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear appears to consist entirely of peripheral blood elements and is inadequate for evaluation.  Megakaryocytes are absent in the hemodilute sample. The cells 
present include occasional maturing myeloid and erythroid elements and many large blasts with large round, prominently
 folded or indented nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin, occasional prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. Some have the appearance of ""cup-shaped"" blasts.

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 25% (range <10% to 40%). 
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is reversed.  Myeloid maturation is
 shifted to the left with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate with overall normal morphology.  The megakaryocytes include oc
casional small forms with hypolobated nuclei.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Plasma cells oc

SUMMARY: The constellation of findings is unusual. Some features are suspicious for myelodysplasia, including the relative erythroid hyperplasia with dyserythropoiesis and increased MCV.  However, the leukopenia is unusually long-standing
 for myelodysplasia, as is the abundance of hematogones in the current sample.  The differential includes an unusual reactive process, in response to patient's other medical problems and/or therapy for those disorders.

Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with a single lymphoid aggregate.

Note:  
The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50%.  Myeloid and erythroid elements are present with decreased M:E ratio, with 
complete maturation.  M
egakaryocytes appear adequate in number, most with normal morphology.
  A few megakaryocytes are small.  Myeloid maturation is complete but slightly shifted to the left.  There is a single non-paratrabecular aggregate of small  lymphoid cells with round to slightly
 irregular nuclei.  Plasma cells occur as scattered mature cells. 
Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  A 200-cell count re
veals: 40% neutrophils and precursors; 42% erythroid precursors; 11% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 2% eosinophils; 1% basophils; 0% promyelocytes; 0% blasts; and 2% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is complete, with occasional nuclear irregularities and binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.

CBC results from 9/10/2012 are as follows: WBC 3.4; HGB 12.7; HCT 39.1%; MCV 103 fl; PLT 85.  Auto differential: 63% polys; 24% lymphs; 9% monos; 3% eos; 1% basos.  
Review of the peripheral smear reveals mild leukopenia with normal leukocytes.  Platelets are decreased.

SUMMARY:  The changes are mild and nonspecific.  
They are not sufficient for a diagnosis of myelodysplasia in the absence of a cytogenetic abnormality. 
Stains are in progress to evaluate the lymphoid and plasma cells further; results will be reported in an addendum.

KARYOTYPE:     46,XY[20]

DNA was isolated from bone marrow and analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction
technique using primers conjugated with fluorescent dyes that hybridize to T
cell receptor gamma chain (TCRg) gene V segment 1-8, 9, 10, 11 (Vg1-8, Vg9,
Vg10, Vg11) and joining region (Jg1 and Jg2) (InVivoScribe Technologies,
BIOMED, San Diego, CA). The DNA was also amplified with control primers to
multiple gene segments (64 to 600 bp in length) to assess the integrity and
quality of the isolated DNA.  The PCR products were analyzed by capillary gel
electrophoresis.

RESULT:
TCR: Dominant peaks seen in an oligoclonal background, including the peaks
identified in the peripheral blood specimen (Vgamma1-8 (216, ND=62; 228, ND=8)
and Vgamma9 (165.6, ND=2.6))

Hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, and scattered lymphoid aggregates.

Note: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 70%.  
The myeloid to erythroid ratio is slightly increased.  Myeloid maturation is complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate with overall normal morphology.  There are scattered
 non-paratrabecular infiltrative aggregates of small lymphoid cells with round nuclei. The lymphoid cells account for <10
% of the marrow cellularity and occupy ~5% of the intertrabecular marrow space.
Plasma cells occur

2297,S12-63272,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LUNG PARTIAL LOBECTOMY, LEFT UPPER LOBE:  
E
xtranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma), 2.4 cm
NOTE:  The mass is <0.1 cm away from the parenchymal resection margin.  The lesion consists of a diffuse, solid proliferation of small lymphoid cells with occasional plasma cells and rare admixed large cells.  Lymphoid cells invade bronchiolar epithelium to form lymphoepithelial lesi
ons.  Lymphoid cells also invade pleura and a few blood vessels.  Lymphoma tracks away from the main mass in a perivascular and interstitial pattern, and is present in the representative section of grossly uninvolved lung.  
Flow cytometry supports the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma (see below).
Immunostains show that the 
lymphoid infiltrate consists predominantly of CD20-positive B cells.  There are scattered interspersed CD3 and CD43 T cells.  Cyclin-D1 is negative among lymphoid cells
.  B cells are negative for CD43.  With immunostains
 for kappa and lambda there are many scattered and loosely clustered kappa+ plasma cells but only a few scattered lambda+ plasma cells.  CD21 highlights disrupted 
follicular dendritic cell meshworks within the lesion.  
The findings support a diagnosis of pulmonary marginal zone lymphoma
. The excess staining of plasma cells for kappa suggests plasmacytic differentiation of the lymphoma. See also results of cytogenetics (CG12-A06397). 

B.  LYMPH NODE BIOPSY, LEFT ANTERIOR HILAR:  
Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with anthracosis.  
NOTE:  Immunostains on the node show CD20+ B cells mainly in follicles and in medullary cords.  There are numerous interfollicular T cells (CD3+, CD43+).  There is no definite evidence of lymphoma in the lymph node.  
 
C.  LUNG LOBECTOMY, LEFT UPPER LOBE:  
Congestion and focal recent hemorrhage.  
There is no evidence of malignancy at the bronchial and vascular resection margin.  
NOTE:  Within the parenchyma are rare small collections of small lymphocytes
 in a peribronchial or peribronchiolar location.  They are composed of a mixture of CD20+ B cells and CD3+, CD43+ T cells.  They are not sufficient for a diagnosis of lymphoma.

INTERPRETATION:     
     Three different abnormal clones are present in 18 of 20 metaphases. The largest
     clone, 11 /20 cells, shows an apparent inversion of 1p and what appears to be
     an interstitial deletion of 2q. The second clone appears to be unrelated to the
     first, showing addition of unknown material on 2q, additional material on 7q,
     and an abnormal 8, possibly a p-q inversion. The third clone is the same as the
     second, but also has additional material on 1p along with the other clone 2
     abnormalities. None of these rearrangements are known to be characteristic on
     any particular type of neoplasia. Note that chromosome morphology is poor;
     listed breakpoints are best estimates.
     
     Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the
     standard methods employed.  Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
     bands or greater.
     
     FISH evaluation for IGH rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis
     LSI IGH Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbott Molecular) at 14q32
     and is interpreted as NORMAL.  No rearrangement was observed in 50/50 nuclei,
     which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
     Laboratory at BWH.  Up to 3% of cells in normal samples can show apparent IGH
     rearrangement using this probe set.  A normal IGH FISH finding can result from
     absence of an IGH rearrangement, from a variant IGH rearrangement, or from an
     insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

CASE: BL-12-K30276
DNA was isolated from paraffin embedded tissue, S12-64230, and analyzed by a
polymerase chain reaction technique using primers conjugated with fluorescent
dyes that hybridize to conserved framework (regions 1,2 and 3) and joining
regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (InVivoScribe Technologies,
BIOMED, San Diego, CA). The PCR products were analyzed by capillary gel
electrophoresis.  DNA was also analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction
technique using primers conjugated with fluorescent dyes that hybridize to T
cell receptor gamma chain (TCRg) gene V segment 1-8, 9, 10, 11 (Vg1-8, Vg9,
Vg10, Vg11) and joining region (Jg1 and Jg2) (InVivoScribe Technologies,
BIOMED, San Diego, CA). The DNA was also amplified with control primers to
multiple gene segments (64 to 600 bp in length) to assess the integrity and
quality of the isolated DNA.  The PCR products were analyzed by capillary gel
electrophoresis.
RESULT:
IgH: Polyclonal pattern.
A clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement is not identified.
TCR: Clonal pattern.
A clonal T cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement is identified with
Vgamma1-8 (239.6 bp) and Vgamma10 (152.6 bp) primers.
INTERPRETATION:
No clonal B cell population is identified by this test.
These findings indicate the presence of a clonal T cell population.
SUMMARY:
The presence of an abnormal karyotype in conjunction with the finding os a clonal T-cell population, together with the histologic and immunophenotypic features described above, confirms a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma."

2333,S12-64230,Final Diagnosis,"A.  RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY:  
Lymphoma, not definitely subclassified. 
Nodular proliferation of Langerhans cells, consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. 

NOTE: The specimen is a markedly enlarged lymph node with architecture that is effaced. There are numerous rounded to slightly irregular nodules of small lymphocytes with few admixed large cells. A few of these dark blue nodules contain rea
ctive-appearing germinal centers, so that they are consistent with altered follicles. The interfollicular area is composed of lymphoid cells with different morphologies. One morphology is of small lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, oval nuclei and condense
d
 chromatin. The other population is composed of medium sized cells with moderate cytoplasm, oval to slightly irregular nuclei and fine chromatin, as well as occasional immunoblasts and in areas, increased high endothelial venules. There is also a large no
dule of histiocytes, many with the appearance of Langerhans cells. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
 
The nodules are composed of B cells (CD20+, CD19+, Pax 5+) with admixed scattered, often clustered, T cells 
(CD 2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, CD4 bright or CD8+, CD43+, PD1 bright). Nodules are associated with irregularly expanded follicular dendritic cell
 meshworks. CD10 stains scattered cells in nodules. Bcl 6 stains a few scattered, rarely clustered cells in nodules. The few discrete germinal centers are CD10-. bcl 6+, bcl 2 -.
Some small B cells are CD21+ (dim). Many of the small B cells in nodules are IgM+, IgD+, as would be expected in follicle mantles. The interfollicular / internodular population is composed of numerous B cells and T cells (CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD4 > CD8,
 PD1 dim, CD43+ with many but not all CD7+). Most of the B and T cells are small or minimally enlarged although a few large B and T cells are seen. CD79a stains B cells in nodules brightly and stains 
interfollicular B cells and B cells in discrete germinal centers very dimly. CD57 stains scattered T cells in and between nodules. There are rare scattered polytypic plasma cells (CD138+, kappa+, lambda+). Rare IgG+ and IgA+ plasma cells are present. 

The aggregated histiocytes are positive for S100 and CD1a and negative for langerin and Pax5.
There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).
Lymphoid cells are negative for cyclin D1. No abnormal B or T-cell population is detected by flow cytometry. Cytogenetic analysis 
(CG12X06520) shows an abnormal karyotype, possibly with a translocation involving IGH@; FISH is pending. Molecular studies (BL12K30276) are also pending.
The histologic findings are highly atypical and are consistent with lymphoma. However it is difficult to subclassify, with populations of both B cells and T cells showing atypical features. Results of pending cytogenetic and molecular st
udies may help to subclassify this lymphoma.  
In rare cases of lymphoma, there is concurrent Langerhans cell histiocytosis, as seen in this case. It is not clear whether the Langerhans cell proliferation represents a l
ocalized reactive process, or is a neoplastic process, possibly clonally related to the lymphoma. 
Dr. Nancy Harris has reviewed representative slides from this case, and agrees with the diagnosis above.
Results were discussed with Dr. Hochberg 10/12/2012.

issue from this case was submitted to the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BL12-M31063
). Results are as follows:

RESULT:
IgH: Clonal pattern.
One peak is seen with framework I (316 bp) primer. More than two peaks
(oligoclonal pattern) are seen with framework II (301, 252 and 243 bp) primer.

TCR: Polyclonal pattern.
A clonal T cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement is not identified.

INTERPRETATION:
The findings indicate the presence of a clonal B cell population (as detected
with the framework I primer set) arising in the setting of restricted B cell
rearrangements (as reflected in the oligoclonal pattern seen with framework II
primer set).

No clonal T cell population is identified by this test.
Correlation with histologic, immunophenotypic, as well as other laboratory and
clinical findings is suggested.

SUMMARY:
In conjunction with the histologic and immunophenotypic findings described above, these results provide support for a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma."

Endometrial polyp.

B.  (ENDOMETRIUM) CURETTAGE:  
Endocervix with dense lymphoid infiltrate with atypical features, suspicious for lymphoma. 

NOTE: The specimen consists of a large section of endocervix with a somewhat patchy, loose to dense infiltrate of lymphoid cells. Most lymphoid cells are small, with a few medium-sized, rarely large lymphoid cells with oval to irregular nuclei and
 scant cytoplasm also present. The infiltrate is associated with sclerosis and crush artifact. The infiltrate shows a tendency to be more dense surrounding glands. The few enlarged lymphoid cells tend to be located around glands. 

Immunostains show a mix of numerous CD20+, Pax5+ B cells and CD3+, CD5+ T cells. Pax 5 highlights the
 enlarged lymphoid cells. There is extensive staining for CD10 which appears cell-associated. Some cells surrounding glands are negative for CD10, likely corresponding to T cells. Bcl 6 stains fewer cells than CD10 
but does appear to stain some of the enlarged B cells. Bcl 2 stains most lymphoid cells including many of the cells concentrated around glands. With antibody to CD21 there are rare tiny foci with possible follicular dendritic cell staining, but the infiltrate is overall diffuse
. With antibody to kappa and lambda there are very rare polytypic plasma cells. An immunostain for TdT is negative. Ki67 (proliferation) stains about 20% of cells. 

The findings are overall suspicious for B-cell lymphoma, possibly of follicle center origin. Tissue will be sent to PCR to try to confirm the presence of a clonal population. Results will be reported separately.

2352,S12-64911,Final Diagnosis,"A.  RIGHT ORBIT BIOPSY:  
B-cell lymphoma with follicle center immunophenotype, not definitely subclassified.  (See note.)
Note:  The specimen consists of fragments of dense fibrous tissue with a prominent
 lymphoid infiltrate with extensive crush artifact.  In the best preserved areas, there are small, medium-sized, and large atypical cells with irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm.  
The proportion of lymphoid cells of different sizes varies from one area to another. There are no definite areas with enough large cells to warrant a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  By 
immunohistochemistry, the lymphoid cells are CD20+, Pax5+/-, Bcl2+ (strongly), and Bcl6+/- B-cells with many interspersed CD3+ T-cells.  CD21 is negative for any follicular dendritic cell staining.  The proliferation index by Ki-67 is approximately 20% in the best preserved areas.  Flow cytometry shows a clonal CD20+ B-cell popul
ation (kappa+).  See also results of cytogenetic studies (CG-12-K06579).  
The findings support a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma with a follicle center immunophenotype, although it is difficult to subclassify precisely.  No obvious follicle formation is seen 
on routine or immunostained sections to confirm a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Of note, in a prior specimen showing follicular lymphoma, the lymphoma was noted to be at least partially diffuse (MS08-60465).  As indicated above, large cells in well-p
reserved areas are not sufficiently abundant for a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
 and the Ki-67 proliferation index is relatively low, although in areas large cells are relatively frequent.
  In summary the findings support a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma with a follicle center immunophenotype, although more precise subclassification and grading are difficult.

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (see note). 

NOTE: The lymph node overall appears somewhat pale and slightly hypocellular. The normal lymph node architecture is replaced by a diffuse infiltrate of 
small to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells with ovoid to irregular nuclear contours, finely granular to smooth chromatin, variably prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of clear cytoplasm with well-defined cell borders. There are occasional admixed 
large atypical cells with oval to irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and vesicular chromatin consistent with immunoblasts. Many high endothelial venules and eosinophils are seen in the background. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. 
Immunohistochemistry
 is performed and reveals that the majority of cells in the node are CD3+ T cells with both CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells present. CD20 stains scattered small, widely separated aggregates of B cells, and also stains fe
w cells outside these aggregates, including some immunoblasts.  PD1 is coexpressed by a subset of the CD4+ cells. The CD4+ PD1+ cells appear overall somewhat enlarged. CD10 and bcl6 stain few scattered cells. CD30 highlights frequent scattered immunoblast
s and smaller cells. CD30+ cells are also often positive with in-situ hybridization
 for EBER. Some of the CD10+, bcl6+ cells may correspond to B cells, although some may correspond to T cells. Many lymphocytes are bcl2+. CD21 and CD23 highlight multiple expanded, highly irregular follicular dendritic cell meshworks. With antibodies to kappa and lambda, there is polytypic staining of many plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells and immunoblasts.

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with histologic features of Kikuchi's disease (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis).
Note:  The specimen consists of slightly to moderately enlarged lymph nodes with follicular and paracortical hyperplasia with multiple small and large aggregates of histiocytes with apoptotic debris in the interfollicular area.  Admixed with histi
ocytes are a few immunoblasts, scattered small lymphocytes and medium-sized cells that may represent plasmacytoid dendritic cells.  Many of the histiocytes have vacuolated cytoplasm.  Neutrophils are essentially absent.  There is capsular and perinodal fi
brosis.  The abundant histiocytes do not form granulomas.  Flow cytometry shows no abnormal B or T-cell population.
Immunostains show many CD20+ B cells in follicles, and occasional B cells scattered outside follicles.  B cells are very infrequent in histi
ocyte-rich areas.  There are numerous paracortical T cells (CD3+); lymphocytes in histiocyte-rich areas are almost all T cells.  CD4+ and CD8+ T  cells are present in similar numbers.  CD123 highlights scattered and clustered plasmacytoid dendritic cells 
within and around  the periphery of histiocyte-rich areas.  Many histiocytes express myeloperoxidase.
Compared to the prior outside lymph node biopsy (S12-70708), the current biopsy shows a higher proportion of vacuolated histiocytes suggesting a later, resolving stage in the inflammatory process.  
The histologic and immunophenotypic features together support a diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis).  As already noted in S12-70708, the histologic features of Kikuchi's dise
ase can overlap with those of systemic lupus erythematosus.  Another unusual feature is that lymphadenopathy in this case involves cervical and axillary areas, whereas Kikuchi's disease typically (although not always) causes isolated cervical lymphadenopa
thy.  
Clinical correlation and follow up to exclude an autoimmune disease and to be certain lymphadenopathy resolves are suggested.

2388,S12-70645,Clinical History,Excision right neck lymph nodes x 3.  Has had right neck lymphadenopathy beginning at age 5.  Multiple biopsies all have shown benign lymphadenopathy by report.
2389,S12-70645,Final Diagnosis,"A.  RIGHT NECK, LYMPH NODES, DISSECTION:  
B-lineage lymphoma with features most consistent with Hodgkin's lymphoma, not definitely subclassified.

Note:  The specimen consists of enlarged lymph nodes
 replaced by a vaguely nodular and diffuse proliferation of small lymphocytes, many scattered and clustered epithelioid histiocytes and scattered large atypical lymphoid cells with large, oval or indented n
uclei, finely stippled chromatin, one or more prominent reddish or amphophilic nucleoli and scant to moderate cytoplasm.  Rare large cells have wreath-like nuclei.  

Flow cytometry shows predominantly T cells and a small polyclonal B-cell population, with no specific abnormality identified (see below).

Immunostains show that large atypical cells are positive for PAX 5, Oct2, Bob1, MUM1
 (some dim), and many are bcl6+. CD30 stains many scattered cells, but most are overall smaller than the large atypical cells.  They are negative for Alk1, CD15 and HHV8. CD15 does stain many of the histiocytes.
 CD20 stains very few large cells, some dim. CD79a also stains a few large cells.  Small lymphocytes are nearly all CD3+ T cells with few CD20+, CD79a+, PAX5+ B cells.  Most of the T cells co-express PD1.  PD1+ T cells tend to rosette around 
large cells.  Stains for CD21 are performed on all 3 blocks.  These show few scattered, usually small, foci of CD21+ follicular dendritic cell
 staining which are widely separated.  CD21 and CD23 both stain a few small B lymphocytes.  There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).

Overall, the findings are those of a lymphoma composed of large B cells that are overall negative for CD20 in a
 reactive background composed almost entirely of small T cells with a few small B cells in a loosely nodular configuration.  The lack of CD20 on large cells and presence of some 
follicular dendritic cell meshworks and some small B cells are against T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma.

Many of the findings fit well with Hodgkin's lymphoma, although subclassification is difficult.  Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, in particular lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a consideration, although the lack of CD15 and equivocal to absent staining for CD30, and expression of both Oct2 and Bob1 are against 
classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Some features suggest a diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, although not typical nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma
 (with a B-cell rich nodular pattern), but rather nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma
 with a T-cell rich nodular pattern and prominent diffuse areas (T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma-like pattern).  However, the lack of CD20 on nearly all large cells is against 
nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In summary, the constellation of findings is highly unusual and the lymphoma cannot be definitively subclassified.  It is overall most consistent w
ith Hodgkin's lymphoma, not definitely subclassified but with many features that would be in keeping with a variant pattern of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, except for the lack of CD20 on large cells.  In a patient reported to have lymphadenopathy since age 5, it is possible that this disease 
has been in evolution for many years, and now has features that differ from those that would usually be found at initial presentation.  Review of prior specimen(s) from this patient's lymph nodes could be informative.

Dr. Harris has reviewed representative slides from this difficult and unusual case.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Takvorian 11/12/2012.

Note:  The 3 specimens show similar findings.  They show squamous mucosa overlying a dense infiltrate composed of medium-sized, occasionally large, atypical lymphoid cells with round-oval, occasionally slightly irre
gular nuclei with finely stippled to finely dispersed chromatin, small to absent nucleoli and scant to moderate quantity of pale cytoplasm.  Crush artifact is prominent.  
Flow cytometry (below) shows a CD10+, monotypic kappa+ B-cell population.  
Immunostains show that atypical cells are positive for CD20 (bright), Pax5, CD10 (bright), bcl6 (bright), MUM1/IRF4, bcl2 (partial, some dim) and are negative for TdT, cyclin D1, EBER and cytokeratin cocktail.  
There is extensive strong staining with CD21 that is likely cell-associated rather than dendritic staining.  Nearly all B cells are Ki67+.  CD3 stains many small T cells mainly in areas not replaced by lymphoma.  
In summary, the specimen shows a B-cell lymphoma that appears high-grade, but is difficult
 to subclassify.  The cell size is overall smaller than is usual for d
iffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but the findings are not
 typical for Burkitt's lymphoma.  The findings are overall consistent with B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.

2404,S12-70906,Final Diagnosis,"A.  LEVEL V LYMPH NODE EXCISION:  

Follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern, grade 1-2 of 3 with slightly elevated proliferation index.  (See note.)

Note:  The specimen is an enlarged lymph node that is mostly replaced by a proliferation of crowded, poorly delineated follicles occupied by a monotonous population of medium-sized lymphoid cells with oval to slightly or moderately irregular nuclei, fine
ly stippled chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent within the atypical follicles.  Centroblasts are infrequent.  Singly scattered epithelioid histiocytes are scattered among atypical lymphoid cells in areas.

Flow cytometry shows a predominant population of CD20+, CD5-, CD10+, monotypic kappa light chain+ B cells (see below).

Immunostains show numerous CD20+ B-cells in large, crowded follicles. There are also many T-cells (CD3+) in an interfollicular pattern.  B-cells coexpress Bcl6 and Bcl2.  Follicles are associated with CD21+ FDC staining.  Lymphoid cells are negativ
e for cyclin D1.  Ki-67 stains 30 to 40% of cells in follicles overall.

The findings are those of a follicular lymphoma.  Although it is low-grade according to centroblast count, the histologic features and borderline elevation of the proliferation index suggest the possibility of more aggressive behavior
 than typically associated with a low-grade lymphoma.

2445,S12-76452,Final Diagnosis,"BONE MARROW (LEFT ILIAC CREST), BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with left-shifted myeloid maturation. 
Peripheral blood with few cells suspicious for blasts.
NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is hemorrhagic, partly crushed, and fragmented but is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 50% (range 20 to 70%). The myeloid to erythroid ratio is decreased. Myeloid maturation is complete but shifted to the left. 
Erythroid maturation is complete. Megakaryocytes are
 increased with overall normal morphology and occur in small clusters. No lymphoid aggregates are seen. Reticulin stain shows 1+ 
with focal areas of 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. Some of the bony trabeculae appear osteoporotic. 
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal scattered and focally clustered small T cells (CD3+).  In few small foci, CD34+ blasts appear slightly increased, although overall fewer than 5% of cells are CD34+.  CD123 
stains a few scattered, rarely clustered small cells.  CD56 stains increased numbers of cells in areas, appearing to correspond to immature myelomonocytic elements.  CD117 stains approximately 10 to 15% of cells.  Rare scattered cells are TdT+.  A few of 
the CD123+ cells co-localize with cells expressing CD56; however, no definite population with the immunophenotype of the original leukemia (co-expressing CD34, CD56, CD123, TdT) is identified. 
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute and paucicellular. A 200
 cell count reveals: 51%
 neutrophils and precursors; 32% erythroid precursors; 10% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 0% eosinophils; 0% basophils; 2% promyelocytes; 3% blasts; and 0% plasma cells.
 Myeloid maturation is left-shifted. Erythroid maturation is
 slightly left-shifted with occasional nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. Occasional blasts appear medium sized with high N/C ratio, round to occasionally irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. 
CBC results from 11/29/12 ar
e as follows: WBC 11.0; HGB 9.7; HCT 28.5%; MCV 89 fl; PLT 463. Manual differential: 46% polys; 12% bands; 3% metamyelocytes; 6% myelocytes; 7% blasts; 10% lymphs; 
6% atypical lymphs; 10% monos. 
Review of the peripheral smear reveals occasional large cells
 with folded nuclei, nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, fine chromatin, and occasional nucleoli suspicious for blasts. Also seen are mature and left shifted granulocytes, and mature monocytes with cytoplasmic vacuoles. 
SUMMARY: The findings are atypical but overall there is no definitive evidence of persistent acute myeloid leukemia. See also results of flow cytometry below. Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12-A07678).

Acute myeloid leukemia.  (See note.)
NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adeq
uate for evaluation.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 60%.  Normal hematopoietic elements are
 decreased.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left with a marked paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid maturation is
 complete, but erythroid elements are significantly decreased.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number.  The megakaryocytes include
 frequent small forms with hypolobated nuclei, a few with separated nuclear lobes.  
Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in di
ffuse sheets and comprise approximately 75% of the cellularity.  The blasts are large with irregular, prominently folded and indented 
nuclei, prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.  Reticulin stain shows 1+, with small foci of 2
+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  A few scattered mature plasma cells are seen.
The aspirate smear is hemodilute.  A 100-cell count reveals: 8% neutrophils and precursors; 
17% erythroid precursors; 
36% lymphocytes; 4% monocytes; 35% blasts.  Maturation of residual myeloid elements cannot be evaluated optimally.  
Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are not seen.  Medium-sized to large cells with fine chromatin, complex nuclear contours, cytoplasmi

2472,S12-77010,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW (LEFT ILIAC CREST), BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR: 
Mildly hypocellular, 
erythroid-predominant marrow with left-shifted myelopoiesis and dysplastic megakaryocytes, consistent with persistent 
myelodysplastic syndrome (see note).  
NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is reversed.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left
, with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid maturation is complete.  Megakaryocytes are increased. The megakaryocytes include frequent small forms with hypolobated nuclei and separated nuclear lobes, as well as scattered
 normal-appearing forms.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 2+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal approximately 5% CD34+ blasts and 10-15% immature CD117+ cells.  
The aspirate smear is markedly hemodilute and paucicellular.  The touch prep slide is somewha
t paucicellular with few areas with optimally preserved cells.  A 1
00-cell count of the touch prep reveals: 13% neutrophils and precursors, 62% erythroid precursors, 13% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 1% promyelocytes, 7% blasts, 
and 1% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted.  Erythroid maturation is complete, with 
occasional binucleation.  Megakaryocytes are present; some appear normal, while others appear dysplastic.  
CBC results from 12/3/12 are as follows: WBC 1.3;
 HGB 12.7; HCT 36.0%; MCV 104 fl; PLT 190.  Auto differential:  19.0% polys; 78.6% lymphs; 0.8% monos; 1.6% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals mostly small mature lymphocytes with occasional
 reactive-appearing forms.  Rare left-shifted granulocytes and few mature granulocytes are also seen.  Rare cells suggestive of blasts are seen.  Rare NRBCs are present.  
SUMMARY:   The findings are consistent with persistent 
myelodysplastic syndrome, although the percentage of blasts appears slightly decreased
 compared to the recent prior specimen (S-12-63932, October 2012).  The blast count in the marrow 
is now in the range of RAEB-1 (refractory anemia with excess blasts-1).  
See also results of flow cytometry below; no increase in blasts is seen, but this may be due to marked hemodilution.  Also see results of cytogenetics (CG-12-07738).

2515,S12-77706,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW (LEFT ILIAC CREST), BIOPSY AND ASPIRATE:
Normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and plasmacytosis (15%) consistent with plasma cell myeloma.  
Amyloid deposition in blood vessels. (See note).

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40%.  
Myeloid and erythroid elements are present in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology.  There is an unusual pattern of distribution of marrow, in that hematopoietic e
lements are preferentially located away from trabecular bone.  Bony trabeculae tend to be rimmed by fat.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Scattered and small clusters of plasma cells with occasional Dutcher bodies are seen throughout the marrow
.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  Bony trabeculae appear osteoporotic.  The walls of some blood vessels in the periosteum have a homogeneous eosin
ophilic appearance; the material is positive with Congo red, with green birefringence, consistent with amyloid.
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation   A 200 cell count reveals: 42% neutrophils and precursors; 27% erythroid precursors; 9% lymphocytes; 2% monocytes; 4
% eosinophils; 1% promyelocytes; and 15% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation is normal.  
Erythroid maturation is normal. Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  Frequent plasma cells with moderate cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli are seen.  Rare Mott cells are seen. Scattered cells have Dutcher bodies.
CBC results from 12/5/12 are as follows: WBC 8.3; HGB 16.3; HCT 46.0%; MCV 87 fl; PLT 238.  Auto differential: 81% polys; 14% lymphs; 4% monos; 0% eos; 0% basos.  The peripheral blood smear is not available for review.
The findings are consistent with plasma cell myeloma, associated with vascular amyloid deposition
.  Clinical correlation is required to distinguish between symptomatic and smoldering myeloma. Immunostains are pending to characterize the plasma cells further; results will be reported in an addendum.

Hypocellular marrow with many scattered blasts, consistent with persistent acute myeloid leukemia.

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 10%.  There is abundant interst
itial eosinophilic material consistent with chemotherapy effects; the scant cellularity includes lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.  Also present are scattered primitive cells suspicious for blasts, including occasional very large forms with prom
inent nucleoli.  Scattered plasma cells with occasional Russell bodies are seen.  Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.  
Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.  
Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal 
that 
CD117 stains approximately 20% of all cells; the CD117+ cells include almost all cells that are not lymphocytes or plasma cells.  Approximately 10% of cells are CD34+, including about half of the CD117+ cells.  Staining for CD61 and for glyc
ophorin is essentially negative among nucleated cells.  
The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation, but paucicellular.  
The touch prep slide is paucicellular.  A 100 cell count reveals: 
19% neutrophils and precursors; 11% erythroid precursors; 47% lym
phocytes; 6% monocytes; 2% promyelocytes; 5% blasts; and 10% plasma cells.  Myeloid maturation cannot be reliably assessed.  
Erythroid maturation is prominently left-shifted.  Occasional medium-sized blasts with round nuclei, occasional nucleoli and scant cytoplasm are seen.  Histiocytes are also seen.
CBC results from 12/5/12 are as follows: WBC 0.3; HGB 8.7; HCT 26.3%; MCV 88 fl; PLT 35.  Auto differential: 3.1% polys; 97% lymphs; 0% monos; 0% eos; 0% basos.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and small mature lymphocytes.  No blasts are seen.

Low-grade B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation in a background of normocellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis (see note). 

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 30% (range 5 to 40%). Myeloid and erythroid elements are pr
esent in normal proportions, with complete maturation. Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number, with normal morphology. There are scattered non-paratrabecular loose clusters and an interstit
ial infiltrate of small lymphoid cells with round to slightly irr
egular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The lymphoid cells account for 20% of the marrow cellularity and occupy 5
% of the intertrabecular marrow space. Occasional mast cells are present among lymphoid cells. Plasma
 cells occur as scattered cells. They consist of mature forms and comprise about <5% of the cellularity. Reticulin stain shows 1+ (out of 4) fiber staining.
 Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case. 

Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal that most lymp
hocytes are CD20+ B cells, scattered and clustered in an interstitial distribution. Many scattered CD3+ T cells are admixed. With 
in-situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains 
there is high background; however, there appear to be scattered monotypic kappa+ plasma cells. 

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.

lasts; and 0% plasma cells.
 Myeloid maturation is normal. Erythroid maturation is complete
 and shows occasional nuclear budding and irregularities. Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal. The lymphocytes are small and have round or slightly irregular nuclei, coarse chromatin and scant basophilic cytoplasm.  

CBC 
results from 12/5/12 are as follows: WBC 8.0; HGB 11.2; HCT 33.3%; MCV 96 fl; PLT 239. Auto differential: 58.9% polys; 29.8% lymphs; 5.5% monos; 5.0% eos; 0.6% basos. 
Review of the peripheral smear reveals
 predominantly mature neutrophils and lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are small with round to irregular nuclei, coarse chromatin and scant cytoplasm. 

SUMMARY: The findings are consistent with marrow involvement by low-grade B-cell lymphoma with
 plasmacytic differentiation. In a patient with an IgM
 paraprotein, the findings are consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. If the patient has splenomegaly, a consideration is splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Clinical correlation is recommended.

INTERPRETATION:
There is no increase in myeloid blasts.  There is no evidence for an unusual T-cell population.  
There is a population (3%) of B cells with some immunophenotypic features of hematogones, and with light chain staining that is difficult to assess, but with apparent excess staining for kappa light chain raising the question 
of a small clonal population.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sample of marrow or blood could be sent to confirm these unusual findings.

2558,S12-78201,Addendum,"ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:

Cytogenetics and FISH on this case (see corresponding report CG12-E07860) revealed an abnormal karyotype:  

KARYOTYPE:     48,XX,+mar1x2[4]/46,XX[16].nuc ish(ETV6,RUNX1)x2[100].

  INTERPRETATION:
     Four  of 20 metaphases contained  2 copies of the same unidentified chromosome marker.
     
     FISH evaluation to rule out a possible i(12p) or i(21q) was performed on 
     nuclei with the Vysis LSI TEL/AML1 ES Dual Color Translocation Probe (Abbott
     Molecular) for TEL (ETV6) at 12p13 and AML1(RUNX1) at 21q22 and is interpreted
     as NORMAL.  No evidence of either i(12p) or i(21q) was observed in 100/100
     nuclei.

Molecular genetic studies (see corresponding reports from Lab Corp & ARUP) revealed the presence of an NPM1 exon 12 mutation, no FLT3 ITD mutation, and no FLT3 exon 20 point mutation.

RT-PCR shows no evidence of a t(15; 17) translocation.

Based on these results in the context of the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings, this leukemia is classified as:

2560,S12-78201,Final Diagnosis,"A.  BONE MARROW (LEFT ILIAC CREST), BIOPSY, ASPIRATE AND PERIPHERAL SMEAR:
Acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation (see note).  

NOTE:   The bone marrow biopsy specimen is adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 90%.  The myeloid to erythroid ratio is markedly increased.  Myeloid maturation is shifted to the left, with a paucity of mature forms.  Erythroid elements are nearly absent.  Megakaryocytes appear adequate in number and occur in focal clusters. The megakaryocytes include frequent small as well as large forms with hypolobated and hyperlobated, complex and hyperchromatic nuclei.  Primitive cells consistent with
 blasts are increased and occur in sheets, and comprise approximately 90% of the cellularity.  The blasts are medium-sized to large with irregular, indented and folded nuclei, variably 
prominent nucleoli, and moderate to abundant cytoplasm.  
No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Scattered plasma cells are seen, sometimes in a perivascular location.  

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation but hemodilute.  The tou
ch prep slide is adequate for evaluation.  A 150-cell count reveals: 24% neutrophils and precursors, 1% erythroid precursors, 12% lymphocytes, 29% monocytes, 6% blasts, and 28% promonocytes.  Myeloid maturation is left-shifted.
  Erythroid maturation is not evaluable.  Megakaryocytes are not seen.  A few Auer rods are seen.  

CBC results from 12/7/12 are as follows: WBC 23.2; HGB 6.9; HCT 21.0%; MCV 88 fl; PLT 48.  Manual differential: 38% polys;  5% metamyelocytes; 9% blasts; 14% lymphs; 26% monos; and 8% 
other WBCs.  Review of the peripheral smear reveals cells with irregular folded nuclei containing fine chromatin, small indistinct nucleoli, and finely granulated cytoplasm consistent with promonocytes (""other WBCs,"" above).  Also seen are cells with fine
 chromatin and scant cytoplasm consistent with blasts, a few of which contain Auer rods.  

SUMMARY:  The findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation.  Megakaryocytes are atypical; the significance of this is uncertain.

There is no morphologic evidence of acute myeloid leukemia (see note). 

NOTE: The bone marrow biopsy specimen is fragmented and hemorrhagic but is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is difficult to estimate because of fragmentation and hemorrhage but appears overall approximately
 30% (range: <5% - 50%). There is interstitial eosin
ophilic material. The myeloid to erythroid ratio is markedly decreased. 
Myeloid maturation is complete but shifted to the left and markedly decreased in quantity. Erythroid maturation is
 complete. Megakaryocytes are decreased with overall normal morphology. No lymphoid aggregates are seen. 
There are scattered lymphocytes, plasma cells, and foamy histiocytes, including phagocytic forms with hemosiderin and occasionally with hemophagocytosis.

psy specimen is adequate for evaluation. The bone marrow clot specimen contains no marrow particles. The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 80% (range 20 to 95%). The myeloid to erythroid ratio is increased. Myeloid maturation is shifted to the le
ft but in area complete.  Erythroid maturation is complete but shifted to the left. Megakaryocytes are increased and occur in frequent clusters. The megakaryocytes include frequent atypical small as well as few large forms, some
 with hypolobated, variably 
hyperchromatic nuclei and separated nuclear lobes. Primitive cells consistent with blasts are increased and occur in loose clusters. The blasts are small with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. No lymphoid aggregates are seen. Overall, 
there are zones of marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and one large fibrotic zone with prominent left shift and frequent blasts. 
Reticulin stain shows 4+ (out of 4) fiber staining. Giemsa stain was examined as part of the histologic evaluation of this case.
There is abundant interstitial collagen, highlighted with a trichrome stain. Immunohistochemical stains of the core biopsy reveal
 numerous scattered blasts positive for CD34 and CD61 but negative for CD117, lysozyme and erythroid markers. Lysozyme stain
s maturing myeloid elements. Glycophorin C and E-cadherin stain few erythroids. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER)
 is negative. 

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation. 
A 200 cell count reveals: 9% neutrophils and precursors; 7% erythroid precursors; 10% lymphocytes; 1% monocytes; 73% blasts. Myeloid maturation is left-shifted. Erythroid maturation is left-shifted. 
Megakaryocytes are abnormal with frequent small and large hypolobated forms with separated nuclear lobes. The blasts are small to medium-sized with round nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and scant blue cytoplasm. 

CBC results from 12/17/12 are as follows: WBC 11.8; HGB 8.5; HCT 26.6%; MCV 88 fl; PLT 82.  
Auto differential: 26% polys; 16% lymphs; 7% monos; 1% eos. Review of the peripheral smear reveals teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, large platelets, and left-shifted myeloids including frequent blasts. 

SUMMARY: The findings are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia.  Cytogenetics (CG-12-A07891) reveals an 
abnormal karyotype:  46,XY,inv(3)(q21q26)[11]/46,idem,i(14)(q10)[9], consistent with acute myeloid leukemia with inv 3 (q21 q 26.2) (RPN1-EVI1).
Acute myeloid leukemia with inv 3 can arise de novo or in association with myelodysplasia and can b
e associated with atypical megakaryocytes and with fibrosis. In retrospect, it is possible that the patient'
s prior long-standing hematologic disorder was myelodysplastic syndrome with fibrosis rather than primary myelofibrosis, Review of earlier marrow bi
opsies, if available, could be informative. Alternatively, if this patient received chemotherapy for his previously diagnosed prostate carcinoma a consideration is a therapy-related leukemia. See also results of flow cytometry

Cellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and a small clonal plasma cell population.  (See note.)

NOTE:  The bone marrow biopsy specimen is small and hemorrhagic but is 
adequate for evaluation.  The bone marrow clot specimen contains adequate marrow particles.  The marrow cellularity is overall approximately 40%.    The myeloid to erythroid ratio is slightly increased.  
Myeloid maturation is complete.
Erythroid maturation is
 complete.  Megakaryocytes are adequate with overall normal morphology.  No lymphoid aggregates are seen.  Plasma cells occur as rare scattered cells with rare small cl
usters. They consist mostly of mature forms and comprise <5% of the cellularity.

The aspirate smear is adequate for evaluation.  
The touch prep slide is paucicellular.  A 200-cell count reveals: 71% neutrophils and precursors; 16% erythroid precursors; 5% lymphocytes; 1% monocytes; 3% eosinophils; 2% basophils; 1% promyelocytes; and 2% plasma cells.  
Myeloid maturation is normal.  Erythroid maturation is normal.  Megakaryocytes are present and appear normal.  Most plasma cells are small and mature with clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and eccentric cytoplasm with a paranuclear 
hof; a few plasma cells are enlarged.

NOTE:  The specimen consists of fibrous tissue with focal minor salivary gland, and extensive involvement by a vaguely nodular
 proliferation of small to medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells with twisted, irregular nuclei, small distinct or inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant to moderate quantity of pale cytoplasm.  Also present are occasional
 large lymphoid cells with large oval nuclei and large nucleoli.  Occasional mitotic figures can be found, but they are not numerous.  
Flow cytometry (see N12-13317) shows a predominant population of B cells t
hat are CD10dim+, CD23dim+, lacking detectable immunoglobulin light chain.

Immunostains show that most cells are CD20+ B cells in a vaguely nodular pattern, with many scattered small T cells (CD3+, CD43+
).  Most B cells are bcl6+, bcl2+.  B cells are negative for CD43 and CD10. Lymphoid cells are negative for TdT and cyclin-D1. Nearly the entire lymphoid infiltrate is encompassed by CD21+ follicular dendritic cell
 meshworks.  With antibody to kappa and lambda, there are a few polytypic plasma cells in the area of the minor salivary gland. 
 There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  Approximately 25% of B cells are Ki-67+ (proliferation).

Nasopharyngeal tissue with slight reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and fibrosis (see note).  

NOTE:   Concurrent flow cytometric analysis showed polyclonal B cells and T cells with no immunophenotypic abnormalities
.  Tissue sections show lymphoid tissue composed of nodules of small lymphocytes in a background of fibrosis, small lymphocytes, and few large lymphoid cells.  Immunostains show that most cells in nodules are CD20+ B cells.  Nodules are associated with CD21+ follicular dendritic cell
 meshworks, indicating that they are follicles.  There are numerous CD3+ T cells throughout.  Bcl-6 stains scattered cells, but dis
crete germinal centers are not conspicuous.  Bcl-2 stains most lymphoid cells.  CD30 highlights scattered cells, but they do not appear atypical.  No atypical cells are detected with antibody to S-100 or HMB-45.  There is no staining with in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).  
The findings are consistent with slightly 
hyperplastic lymphoid tissue with fibrosis.

Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) (see note).

NOTE:  The lung wedge contains multiple large, focally confluent lymphoid nodules distributed throughout the

ed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and moderate pale cytoplasm.  Areas of hemosiderin deposition are present within the lymphoid aggregates.  Also seen within the lymphoid nodules are poorly
 delineated aggregates of larger cells with mitoses and tingible body macrophages, likely residual reactive germinal centers.  The lymphoid infiltrate focally abuts on the inked margin. Flow cytometry (below) supports the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma.  
The histologic and immunophenotypic findings together support the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. Dr. Eugene Mark
